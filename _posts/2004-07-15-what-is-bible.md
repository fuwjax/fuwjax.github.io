For whatever reason, during Bible study last night, the following thought process flashed through my head almost faster than I could follow.  Whether it is true or not is debatable, but it was an interesting thought process.

The Bible is not a rulebook, though it does contain God's Law.  The Bible is not a recipe for good living, though it does contain guides to wisdom and discernment.  The Bible is not the sum total of God's communication to us, though it is the inerrant Word of God.

The first thought that flashed through my head is that the Bible is God's welcome mat.  It is what lies between the dirtiness of the world and the sanctity of God's family and home.

Then that thought vanished and was replaced by this.  It's not a welcome mat, once you're in the house, the welcome mat stays outside.

The Bible is not a welcome mat, it's my birth certificate.
