###Summary of [1 Cor 3](http://biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&passage=1+cor+3&version=NIV):

But I had to treat you gently because of your young faith.  And you are still not ready to be addressed as spiritual because of your jealousy and quarreling.  For are you not using the foolish wisdom of men when you bicker about which messenger you follow.

These messengers are only servants in whom you came to believe in the one who sent them.  They were only doing the work the Lord has assigned to them, some to bring you the message, others to encourage you to believe.  But it is the Lord alone who makes this faith grow in you.  We are only workers in God's field, which is you.

By God's grace, I brought to you the message of truth, the foundation of faith.  Any one who encourages you in your faith should be careful in building on this foundation, which is Jesus Christ.  Those who build on this foundation will have their work shown for what it truly is when our Lord returns.  Those who have built things which are eternal will have their reward, but those who have built worldly things will see their work burned up.  They will be saved, though everything else will be lost.

Don't you know that you are God's sacred temple and that His Spirit dwells in you?  God will destroy anyone who destroys His temple.

Don't fool yourselves.  Those who think they are wise in the wisdom of men should become a "fool" to become wise in God's wisdom.  So stop boasting of which messenger you follow.  All things have been given to you, for you are of Christ and Christ is of God.

###Favorite Passage of 1 Cor 3:

> Don't you know that you yourselves are God's temple and that God's Spirit lives in you?  If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him; for God's temple is sacred, and you are that temple. - 1 Cor 3:16,17

###Thoughts on 1 Cor 3:

I have to admit, I've been feeling pretty blah lately.  I'm not doing very much at work.  I'm just not really feeling very useful at the moment.

My brother and his family are moving to the east coast in a few weeks.  Don't get me wrong, I'm glad he's got such a great job and that things seem to be going so well for him.  It's just gonna be a little less frequent that we get to see each other.

And I should also admit, that life does get pretty lonely sometimes.  I have lots of roommates, and more friends who truly deeply love me than any man could ever hope for.  But yeah, sometimes it seems the only people who really care to listen to my incessant babbling are the voices in my head.

But even in my worthlessness, I am God's temple.  And though I might feel lonely, I am not alone, God's Spirit dwells within me.  And no matter how much I might feel that I'm being crushed, I know that God will deliver me.  I am sacred to Him, because he has made me holy.

I'm not so worthless, not so lonely.  And though I might feel despised and rejected, I am a child of the living God.  This is what Christ's death and resurrection have bought me, this is what His Spirit dwelling within me produces.  

This is why I love Him, because He has so often shown that He loves me.
