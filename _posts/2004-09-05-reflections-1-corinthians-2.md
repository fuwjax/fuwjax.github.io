So it turns out that my friend is not blogging to colouredpyrex but to [starryskie](http://starryskie.blogspot.com).  So drop by if you'd like, at least until she changes it again because I've supplied you with a link.

### Summary of [1 Cor 2](http://biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&passage=1+cor+2&version=NIV):

I came to you in weakness and fear, without eloquence or wisdom, armed only with the knowledge of Christ and his death.  This was so my preaching might be a demonstration of the Spirit's power, that God's power alone and not the wisdom of man would supply your faith.

Though the message we bring is separate from the wisdom of man, even of the rulers and powers of this world, it is God's secret wisdom, wisdom kept hidden since the dawn of time.  None of the rulers and powers knew of this wisdom, for if they had, Christ would not have been crucified.  God's wisdom is outside of even the imagination of man, it is revealed only through God's Spirit.

His Spirit knows His thoughts, just as our spirit knows our inner secrets.  And it is this same Spirit we have received that we might understand what has been given to us in Christ and his crucifixion.  And this is what we have preached not through our own words, but in words taught by the Spirit.  To the mind of man these words seem foolish, he does not accept the things that come from the Spirit.  But we have the mind of Christ.

### Thoughts on 1 Cor 2

My mom died this past January.  Even before she went home, I used to think about what heaven would be like.  Now, I admit, I think about it a lot.  I wonder what my mom's doing now.  I wonder if "now" even has any meaning when you're staring down the business end of infinity.  I just wonder.

And I think a lot about what it'll be like when Christ comes back.  How will we know?  The last time he showed up on earth, he came as a baby.  We're told the next time he will come back as he left, riding the clouds, announced by the trumpet call.  Man, I wonder what that'll be like, I wonder a lot.

I wonder about a lot of things.  Where am I heading next?  When will "next" get here?  Why do I always feel like I'm always arm wrestling the world and I'm about beat?  Why do I disagree with everything?  Why am I always so restless?  What am I even longing for?

No one had any idea Christ was coming as a baby.  No one had any idea he was going to hang on a cross and die.  No one had any idea that his death and his resurrection would bridge the gap between us and God that we created with our sin.  No one even imagined that God could die and that his death would give us life.

No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has conceived what God has prepared for those who love him.

I don't have the faintest idea what heaven is like.  I know what the bible says about heaven, but I also know there were lots of people who could tell you all about the Messiah before Christ came.  And though they would know everything that the Bible said about him, they wouldn't have the faintest idea what Christ's coming was really going to do.

I don't pretend to know what his second coming will really do either.  I have lots of pictures, lots of images.  But we have a God who delights in blowing our minds, in doing more than we could have ever imagined.  I wonder a lot.  But when he comes back, it will be foolishness by comparison.

The incredibly great thing is that he's blowing my mind right now.  The answers to all those questions, Where am I going, When will I get there, the answers to these questions are going to blow my mind.  He already told me that I can't even imagine it.  And if where he's leading me is anything like what he's brought me through, he's not lying.
