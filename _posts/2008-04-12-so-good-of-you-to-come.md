Hey, how's it going? ...

Yeah, sure I'd love to sit down and chat for a while, thanks for asking...

No no, I'm fine. Really, I am. I know I've had some pretty intense rants lately...

Haha, right right, Christians v. Atheists, Pro-life v. Pro-choice. You're right, I'm pretty much attacking both sides of any argument I can find...

Who's next? Well, I don't know, that's a good question. I suppose if I had to pick right now I'd have to say Me v. Me...

Well, sure, but did you really expect me to say anything that makes sense at first glance? I mean, if there's anything I enjoy doing, it's not making sense as often as it makes sense to do so...

No, it's not really a fight against myself, that's not what I'm trying to imply. Maybe it would have been better to say Me v. I. Or maybe even better, Me v. "I"...

Sure, that's been my stance for some time. What is your "Y"? Is it "I" or Love? Yeah, I know, I've been on this kick for years now. But it's finally starting to ring in my ears a lot more frequently, a lot more loudly, and it's making its way out of me in the form of these rants...

Why do I think it's happening so much more frequently? That's a great question. That's an awesome question. I'm sick of "I", of "me". I'm sick of hearing what I'm supposed to do, what I'm supposed to say, how I'm supposed to live. And I've started noticing just how much I hear it...

No no, this isn't just a rebellion against authority or something like that. It's much deeper. Everyone keeps acting like being a Christian is about being a good person. And I'm sick of being told I'm supposed to conform to someone's idea of a good person...

But is it God's idea of a good person? God's idea of a good person seems to me to be one of two things: Either someone who repents, or someone who is perfect. I have no problem with anyone telling me to repent, to turn away from the stuff that drives a wedge in the relationship between me and God. But I have a huge problem with anyone telling me to be perfect...

But that's not true; people are telling me to be perfect. Chasing what is good because you say it is good, because you say it makes you more acceptable to God, this is chasing perfection, not forgiveness. Pretending to be nice and holy and pure isn't about being good, it's about putting on pretenses. It's about the act, not about God...

No, now look. How many times have you been told that you need to go to church, that you need to be in small group bible study, that you need to have quiet time? How many times has someone, whether they meant to or not, made you feel guilty for failing to live up to some ideal of spiritual life? How often has someone laid out Christianity for you as some set of rules, duties, or rituals?...

Of course, please understand, I'm not saying that you shouldn't do these things. Making up anti-rules is just as stupid as making up rules in the first place. I'm not trying to say we should burn all the bibles. What I am saying is that this isn't about me. This isn't about what I can do or what I should do or what I can't do or what I haven't done. This isn't about me...

What "this"? Life, living, relationships, work, play... pick something, pick anything. I'm sick of "me". I'm sick of "I". Don't you understand? This is why I fell at His feet in the first place...

Yes yes, it's about Him. It's about what He has done. It's about what He has said. It's about the promises He has made and has kept. It's about the gifts that He has given and the changes He has made. I worship Him because He is God, He lives, He saves, He redeems. So why when we get to church do I have to sing things that make me the focus? Why do I need to be given topical advice on how to live my life?...

But don't you see? Jesus said "let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven." Paul says "For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do." It's not my responsibility to make sure I'm doing enough good works. It's God's. Whatever good I have done, it is God who has given me the strength, the skills, and the opportunity to do it. Whatever evil I have done, it is God who has sacrificed his own Son to atone for my sins, set me free from the eternal penalty, and given me a new life as His child. It's not about me. It's not about what I've done. Whether I did good or evil, it is God who has revealed His glory and His power to me and through me. It is God who should be praised for it is God who is good...

Yeah, I'm sorry, I feel like I'm not making much sense. So let me just leave you with this. God is big. He's so incredibly big. He has done so much; wherever you look, you can witness His handiwork. So please, stop being concerned with how righteous the world is compared to you, how good you are, how much better you are. He has made you better. He has made you good. He has made you righteous. There is no room to have any pride in anything other than the might of our God. There is no room to worship anything but Him. There is absolutely no way to look at yourself and say, "I'm good" without first saying "Oh God, you have made me good."...

So yeah, I think it's great to read your bible. But reading the bible doesn't make you good. And spend time with others in the Faith, it's a great way to find encouragement and accountability. But spending time with others in the Faith doesn't make you good. Do these things because God has given them to you. He has given you these things so that you might see him more clearly, even if it's not completely clear. That's the same reason he's given you the good works he has prepared in advance for you to do, that you might see him more clearly and that those around you might do the same...

Haha, yes yes. Amen...
