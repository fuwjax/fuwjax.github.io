I asked of my mom, “Mom, what would you do?
What would you do with a bug in your shoe?”
“What would I do? Why I’d scream and I’d fuss,
Till your father came in to check on the mess
And took the shoe out with the bug trapped within
And disposed of the bug and then brought the shoe in.
But why do you ask what I’d do with a bug?”
I did not say a word, I turned with a shrug.

I inquired of my dad, “Dad, what would you do?
What would you do with a bug in your shoe?”
“What would I do? Why I’d smash it down flat,
With maybe a book or a chair or a bat.
I’d crush it quite dead, which might ruin my boot
But one thing’s for certain, I’d be done with the brute.
But why do you ask what I’d do with a bug?”
I only looked down and smoothed out the rug.

I queried my uncle, “Uncle, what would you do?
What would you do with a bug in your shoe?”
“What would I do? Why I’d bottle it up,
In a glass or a vase or a clear see-through cup.
I’d study it closely till I knew what it was.
I’d search in my books for its wings and its claws.
But why do you ask what I’d do with a bug?”
I straightened my shirt; gave my collar a tug.

I questioned my grandpa, “Grandpa, what would you do?
What would you do with a bug in your shoe?”
“Chugging some glue? Why would I do that?
Oh plugging my flue? It might be the cat
Drugging the crew? Goodness me boy
What odd little questions you seem to enjoy.
But why do you ask what I’d do in a zoo?
I left the room in a rush, grandpa hadn’t a clue.

I next quizzed my granny, “Granny, what would you do?
What would you do with a bug in your shoe?”
“What would I do? Why it depends on the pest
A beetle I’d flush, that would be best.
A moth out the window, a bee out the door.
A spider I’d chase with a broom round the floor.
But why do you ask what I’d do with a bug?”
I just shook my head as she sipped from her mug.

I sat down on the porch. “Well, what should I do?
What should I do with a bug in my shoe?
Mom would just panic, Dad would destroy it
Uncle would research, Granddad would ignore it
Grandma would clean, that much is true
They would all get rid of a bug in their shoe.
But what should I do? Something less grim.
Get rid of the bug? It took so long just to catch him."
