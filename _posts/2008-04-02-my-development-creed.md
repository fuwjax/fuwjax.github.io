I believe software development is a conversation between individual developers, users, clients, managers, testers, analysts, architects, operators, lawyers, accountants, CxO's and occasionally the janitor.

I believe software is valuable in as much as it satisfies the concerns of all these parties; specifically, valuable software is maintainable, usable, and cost-effective.

I believe compromises between these concerns are an unavoidable and necessary consequence of the conversation.

I believe processes, tools, documents, contracts, and plans can help manage these compromises.

I believe the individual participants, through collaboration and interaction, can respond to inevitable change to produce working software more valuable than compromise alone could deliver.

I believe change can be more efficiently handled by more confidently understanding the current state and direction of the individuals, rather than the current state and direction of the processes, tools, documents, contracts, and plans.

My goal is to research and develop ways to facilitate open dialog throughout the software lifecycle from inception to retirement.
