> If you could sacrifice your son and save the whole world, wouldn't you? What's the big deal about God's sacrifice then; he did what any rational dad would do...

Aside from the obvious fact that this is a statement that would only seem rational to the childless, let's spend some time looking at the crap ton of assumptions made in such a ridiculous question.

For starters, this cost-benefit analysis assumes that the whole world is saved by said sacrifice. And yet the bible is clear that not all are saved.

"The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with the work of Satan displayed in all kinds of counterfeit miracles, signs and wonders, and in every sort of evil that deceives those who are perishing. They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved." 2 Thessalonians 2:9-10

If you could sacrifice your son just to offer everyone in the whole world salvation, would you? That seems much less cut and dry to me.

But let's not romanticize it. This isn't trading one innocent person for millions of other innocent people. God sacrificed the only innocent man for the sake of the guilty.

If you could sacrifice your son just to offer everyone in prison the opportunity to get out of jail, would you? But this still barely scratches the surface of the sacrifice.

Let's pretend for just a moment that you had a girlfriend back in high school. She was the perfect girlfriend, beautiful and brilliant. You'd hang out together all the time and talk and laugh and generally feel quite good about the world. Until the day she dumped you. This was no "Dear John" breakup; she humiliated you in front of the whole school. It was a complete bridge burner.

After you both went your separate ways, she took a severe turn for the worse. A life characterized by drugs and violence; she sold herself in every possible way to anyone with money. She did things that haven't even been named on UrbanDictionary. And every chance she got, she publicly derided you. She cursed you, blamed you, defamed you with vigorous hatred.

But you went on to get married. You married a woman far above any girlfriend you'd ever dated. She defines beauty and wisdom. Every moment with her is memorable and precious. Every second is an experience, every day is a lifetime. Your souls, your hearts, your very essence have become completely intertwined. She is as much a part of you as you are. This is love.

Through a series of events, you discover that this old girlfriend is wanting to get cleaned up, but doesn't know how. You run a rehab clinic and so that you can continue to serve in your position, you buy a round trip ticket for your wife and a one way for your ex so that she can sober up.

But as soon as your ex realizes she is face to face with your wife, she kills her in cold blood on the spot.

She continues in her depravity to new lows. And at her absolute worst, she decides to use the one way ticket. Whether you send her to jail or shoot her on sight, she doesn't care. She just can't go on any longer in the hell she's trapped in.

And when she shows up at your door... You don't shoot her. You don't hand her over to the police. You bring her in. You clean her up. You give her new clothes and a new home. And you don't just send her back on her way. You give her everything you had given your wife. You marry her. You marry her because you love your wife, and her sacrifice has made all the difference.

This story is so completely far fetched as to be absurd, but this is terrifically close to what has really happened. But even this little parable falls short. Jesus knew the whole time he would have to die. He had to watch every single sin. He had to listen to every blasphemy. He had to bear all of our hatred, all of our insults, and he had to do the one thing that no God could ever do. He had to die. He had to give up his very nature to save those who by their very nature betrayed him and killed him.

And then, it's not for a single one way ticket. I have complete freedom. I walk away constantly, I insult him incessantly, and he brings me back each time. He restores me and continues to give me my freedom. He won't marry me against my will. He wants me to want him.

So yeah, no one has ever heard of a sacrifice like this. This is different. This is love.
