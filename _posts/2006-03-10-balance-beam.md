Truth is, I don't know anything about her.  It's possible I might have heard her name in passing.  It's possible that a buddy's girlfriend had a class with her once.  It's possible that an old friend trained her before leaving for a new job.

Truth is, I'm not sure I want to know anything about her.  It's a violation of the first rule of attraction to hold on to any feeling for a woman who is being paid to be attractive.  It's just very rare for any woman to be attractive to me any more.  The women I know these days don't know the first thing about being attractive.  They think it's about make up and clothes and overt flirting.

It's about the little things, the details.  It's about taking the screw ups and making them special.  It's about looking at the right time, talking at the right time, smiling at the right time, walking away at the right time.  It's about movement and conversation.  It's about being in control and being vulnerable.  It's about being attainable and unreachable.  It's about the hunt and the game and the chase.  It's about opportunities and options and choices.  She's good at the little things.

Truth is, I'm not going to know anything about her.  I play the game to play, not to win.  I hunt to study my prey, not to catch it.  I'm way more attracted to the principles of attraction than the object of attraction.  I'm interested in her because I'm interested in my reaction to her.  

Perhaps it's a bit twisted, but in the end you're the one who's climbed this little mountain in search of a tiny pearl of wisdom.  It shouldn't be too shocking to find that the pearl is the reason I think the oyster is beautiful.
