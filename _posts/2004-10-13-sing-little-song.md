I ran across this song the other day.  I couldn't find the lyrics online, so I'm posting them here.  It's called "Around My Neck" by [100 Portraits](http://www.100portraits.com)

> The cross I wear around my neck,
> what does it mean if it does not mean death?
> Please tell me if it doesn't mean blood 
> or nails or crying or lonliness?
> 
> The cross I wear around my neck,
> what is it for if it is not for breaking?
> If it's not for pain, nakedness, 
> or hammering?
> 
> The cross I wear around my neck
> is being raised above my head.
> I think this time it's wearing someone else.
> I see it drop into the ground,
> and when it falls I hear the sound
> of someone crying "I love you."
> 
> The cross I wear around my neck,
> what does it mean if it does not mean love?
> Please tell me if it doesn't sing 
> of hope and healing and forgiveness?
> 
> The cross I wear around my neck,
> who is for if it is not for me?
> If it's not for sin and all my searching 
> for the innocence?
> 
> The cross I wear around my neck
> is being raised above my head.
> I think this time it's wearing someone else.
> I see it drop into the ground,
> and when it falls I hear the sound
> of someone screaming "I love you."
> 
> The cross I wear around my neck,
> who is it for if it is not for us,
> the lame, the blind, the ones held captive, 
> and the fatherless?
