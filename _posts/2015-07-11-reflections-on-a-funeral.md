Psalm 46 echoes
Pews vibrate
Distant thunder
Of friends and family
A laugh breaks the low rumble

"Man, look at all the people"
Is this the measure of a man?

Add them all up
The money, the years
The memories, the tears
The heart holes
Left void today
Or how long they stay

Is greatness measured
In what was lost
Or what is left?

Write the saltwater stories
Braille on the carpet
Hold tight to the rest
Tucked away in the bottom drawer
With the black tie

"Can I get you anything
A soda, a stool, a breath mint?"
A scotch neat and a hug
From the man too tired to get up

"Here lies a man"
But none of us believe it
Here lies a body in a box
With a few notes to Paw Paw
And a screen printed tee

"You can't take it with you"
But we all do
Tchotchkes stuffed in heart holes
