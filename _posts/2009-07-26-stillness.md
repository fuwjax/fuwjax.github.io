It's funny, I daydream about fighting, about defending all my ideas and decisions and friendships and beliefs. I daydream about loss and grief and suffering. I daydream about my failures and other's success. And apparently the solution to all of that is to be still.

And in being still, I am confronted by God for who he is, his power and might and majesty. He will be exalted. And he will reveal that through stillness.

And I am a torrential storm. I find creative ways of destroying everything in my path. I almost cried when I saw that verse in the concordance. Being still is a rebuke full of blessing. 

He will fight for me. He will take away my grief and suffering. He will be my success. He will reveal himself as the exalted one over the nations. He will turn my destructiveness into beauty. He is God.
