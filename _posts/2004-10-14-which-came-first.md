Following one of my previous blog posts, my brother asked "Is forgiveness a response to repentance, or is repentance a response to forgiveness?"

Repentance is a response to God's call to leave our sin and return to him.  Forgiveness is the visible result of a merciful God.  Forgiveness is a gift given independent of repentance, however without repentance we reject its utility in our lives.

Sin builds a debt against our God.  Guilt is the result of being unable to bear the weight of that debt.  Repentance is subjecting ourselves to the terms of repayment of that debt.  Forgiveness is being released from that repayment, the wiping away of the debt.

True repentance is turning back to God with the understanding that the debt to God I have accumulated through my sin is mine to repay, while at the same time acknowledging that I do not have the power or resources to repay this debt.  True repentance is realizing the debt will only be settled through God's mercy by his forgiveness, yet humbly coming before him without expectation of this forgiveness armed only with the knowledge that we could not be more undeserving of his

mercy.

This forgiveness however has already been given to us, it has already been promised.  Without repentance, we make forgiveness utterly useless in our lives.  It cannot effect a change within us, a realignment of our motivations and directions, while we resist its working.

So am I forgiven if I am unrepentant?  What does it even matter?  If I reject the gift what difference is it if I "received" or "accepted" or whatever word one might use there.  I know only this, I have never found myself repentant yet unforgiven.  His promises have always held true.  When I repent I find his mercy waiting with forgiveness, it does not show up later.  Repentance is not a request for forgiveness, if anything it is turning around to find God waiting with arms outstretched.  In repentance, I don't have time to ask for forgiveness, it's already mine.

So repentance is independent of forgiveness and yet repentance cannot of itself release us from our debt.  Forgiveness too is independent of repentance, yet by God's design will not, without our consent, release us from our debt.  The two concepts are completely separate, though not inseparable.  Both in fact are responses to the effect of sin in our lives.  We long to be out from under the weight of our own sin; repentance is the natural response to that longing coupled with the fact that we cannot by our own efforts remove that weight.  God longs to restore communion with the creation which has separated itself from him through sin; forgiveness is the natural response to that longing coupled with the fact that we cannot by our own efforts remove that separation.

So repentance is our response to sin, a reaction to the conviction of the law.  Forgiveness is God's response to sin, a reaction of the mystery of his mercy.
