Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls... I recently realized that all the stuff I'd ever written about Bonfire has been taken off the web.  This simply cannot be tolerated.  I'm not going to claim it's worth reading for anyone else, but I still need to read it from time to time.

I wrote this originally back in the fall of 2000, my first semester as a prof at A&M.  Some of it might be hard to follow, and if there's anything too confusing, just post a comment and I'll do my best to explain.

So here it is, along with as many of the original comments as I could scavenge.  The original response to "[Fuwjax], what do you think about Bonfire?"

---

Now there's a question, if ever I heard one.  I think about Bonfire all the time.  More than I think about Freebirds.  Possibly even more than I think about math.

I love Bonfire.  Bonfire did what it set out to do perfectly.

"[Fuwjax], you've got to be kidding... Bonfire is such a waste."

Of what?  Honestly, of what?  Of oak trees?  How much paper do you waste in taking notes in class?  How useful are those notes when it really boils down to it?  How often do you crack open that book you paid for?  Just because you bought it, does that mean it's not wasted?  How about the countless reams of paper wasted on government red tape, or tucked away in a library you don't even know exists?

"But [Fuwjax], come on, all that stuff is at least useful."

Bonfire does what it sets out to do perfectly... let me explain.

Life in high school was stupid.  Everything was about who you hung out with.  It was all about appearance and what clothes you had and who you took to homecoming and whether you played football.

And then I got to A&M.  I wanted a new start.  I wanted to be respected for who I am, not who I know.

I tried to join all kinds of clubs.  My resume was week, my people skills were poor.  They didn't care who I was as a person, they just cared about who I was on paper.

I was so incredibly angry.  I didn't leave my room for a month except to go to class and Sbisa.  I went home every weekend.

But I promised an old friend, actually Rick, the owner of Zapatos, that I would try Bonfire just once.

I went and I hated it.  It was hard work.  And that first day we dropped so many trees we couldn't even carry them all out.  I never hurt so bad in my entire life.

But that next weekend I went back out.

I only missed one cut in the seven years I've been here.

You see Bonfire is different.  Bonfire removes all the stupid stuff.

Everyone is dirty.  You wear old clothes that you never wash.  You use words your mom would slap you for using.  You sweat, you bleed, you blister.

And the whole point is... well, there is no point.

You see, that's the beautiful thing.  There was no reason to be out there.  We weren't building homes for the homeless, we weren't cleaning up trash on the side of the road.  Those aren't bad causes, but you must understand, what we did was above "causes."

Everyone had their own motivation.  Some did it for Aggie Spirit.  Some did it to push themselves farther than they'd ever been pushed.  I did it for the freshmen.  But there wasn't a real reason.

And everyone hated you for it.  People would laugh at you when you'd walk across campus.  They'd cross the street so they wouldn't have to even look at you.  I had someone once tell me I was a waste of oxygen.  

I built Bonfire that year for that person.

You see, Bonfire taught us, in the craziest possible way, to love.

I started to see people as people.  It didn't matter what their major was or where they came from.  It didn't matter what they did in high school or how they did on their chem test.

You could tell if people were strong; not just in their arms, but their hearts and souls and heads.  You could see if they were in it for the glory.  You could tell if they considered you a brother; if they believed that Aggies should respect those who came before and serve those who come after.  You could see the fire in their eyes... the passion, the desire.  You could see, even if it was just for a couple months, how good it is just to be alive, to belong to a group not because you were good at something, or because you knew the right person.  For the first time in my life, people liked me only because I wanted to belong, because I would be there for them and they would be there for me. Not just while building a stupid pile of worthless wood, but whenever they needed me, any time for the rest of my life, I'd be there.

I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to rant.  I didn't mean to start crying.

And I am so sorry.  I wish I could have known the future.  I wish this time last year I could have said something or done something to change what happened.  I am so sorry that something this incredible, this perfect was taken from you.

And I want my friends back.

But this is where we are: 12 of my friends are dead and I can't share something I passionately believe in with you.

I don't like how the administration handled this.  I don't like how the KTFB guys handled this.  I don't like how anyone handled this.

The important thing to everyone is that stupid pile of wood.  That's it.  I don't give a concrete wall in water about that pile of wood.  I want something, anything that builds unity, that ties us together as Aggies, that's so overwhelmingly pointless that the only reason you would ever even consider participating is out of love for your fellow Ags.

Here's the bottom line, ladies and gents... To my knowledge there is only one way to learn how to love, and that's to get out there and hurt and work and put your life on the line for someone who doesn't care about your effort.  That's why Christ was born.  That's why I built the hell.  That's why I teach.

I wish you could have learned what Bonfire really was.

What do I think about Bonfire?  I think it taught me more about respect, love, steadfastness, perseverance, courage, strength, passion, compassion, intensity, commitment, and leadership than anything I have ever, or could ever experience.  I learned how to survive, handle, and ultimately triumph over cold, hunger, hatred, insult, ridicule, anger, discrimination, and sleeplessness.  I learned what it means to work hard, to help out, to play, to fight... to live.

What do I think about Bonfire?  It was Life-in-a-Box.  Some people try to package that up and sell it...  Life's little instructions and Be all that you can be and just do it... but we had it for free.

What do I think about Bonfire?  It's like my grandpa.  He's probably the best thing that ever happened to me and I don't know what I'd ever do without him.

What do I think about Bonfire?  If you could see through my tears, you could see it in my eyes.

What do I think about Bonfire?  What could I ever not think about Bonfire?

What do I think about Bonfire?

What do I think about Bonfire?

What do **I** think about Bonfire?

I love you
