As computers become more a part of our lives, it is our responsibility to understand better how they work, and what they can be asked to do for us.  In short, I think people who use computers should learn how to program.

Most of us use our computers for email and chat.  We have what amounts to a thousand dollar pager.  These little gray boxes are terrifically useful, if only we understood what they can do.

My invitation to you today is to try [Python](http://python.org).  It is a programming language devoted to being useful and nothing more.  There aren't any philosophical issues involved with it; it doesn't have the security sandbox mindset of Java or the antiquated syntax of C.  It's just a new language, nothing more.

Best of all, the language, interpreter, and quite a few programming tools are all free.  The [documentation](http://python.org/doc/) is quite good, and the [tutorial](http://docs.python.org/tut/tut.html) is excellent.  If you're technically minded at all, give it a shot.

I realize it's very unlikely that you've heard of Python before.  However, unless you're still living in the dark ages, you use it all the time on your [favorite search engine](http://google.com).
