You can't drag me from the tv right now.  These two weeks, I'm glued to the screen.  If the olympics are on two channels, I'm watching both.  I'll stay up till they replay the same stuff from earlier in the day.

I don't watch just because I love when an American gets the gold.  I don't care at all about the gold medal.  I watch non stop and I don't have the faintest idea what the medal count is.

The olympics are completely totally soley about one thing and one thing only.  Winning.  Nothing else matters.

Pretty confused?

Winning isn't about the medals.  It's not about beating everyone else.  It's about beating yourself, your best, your expectations, rising even above your dreams.  The olympics are about becoming immortal, not by becoming famous, but by following in the footsteps of that first Greek marathoner, pushing yourself further, farther, harder than anyone thought possible.  Risking everything, laying all that you are on the line, to be better than the best.

Last night Pablo won the first American Judo medal, today Jacobson won the first American fencing medal, followed by Zagunis winning the second.  And last Sunday, Sandeno almost beat out the heavy favorite in the women's 400m IM.  These people are winners, regardless of the metal of their medal.  I couldn't be more proud of these athletes.  It's a shame only the people who raise the medal count get airtime.  There are thousands of winners in Athens right now.

And Puerto Rico.... I will never forget their basketball team.  There is no such thing as a Most Valuable Team in the olympics, but I think the honor would definitely go to their basketball team for beating us at our own game.

Now, go away.  I might write again soon.  It might be two weeks.  I don't much care.  The olympics are on, blogging can wait.
