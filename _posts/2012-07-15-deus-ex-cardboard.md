I really wish I could figure out how to write this post. I've tried a few times to no avail. Thankfully, I'm quite resourceful, so you can hear what I can't write.  [Listen to Deus Ex Cardboard](http://fuwjax.podbean.com/mf/play/v5e9y3/20120714182348.m4a "No, please don't"). I'll keep trying to write this post. To my ears, this is the best thing that's fallen out of my mouth in quite some time. At the very least, those of you who haven't heard one of my soliloquies in person in many moons get to reminisce a bit. Just close your eyes while you listen and picture me walking back and forth waving my arms around like a marionette on a mission.
