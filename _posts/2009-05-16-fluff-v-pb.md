This is the story, so true but so sad  
Of Cap'n Fluffypants run in with that dastardly cad  
That vile vitriolic villain of venomous woe  
That infamous thief with the gangrenous toe  
His crimes are displays of his powerful might  
Yes the one the only Bucktooth the Pirate  

Cap'n Fluffenstuff had bravely traveled the seas  
Protecting crew and cargo as her ship followed the breeze  
She bounced port to port procuring her wares  
Particularly peaches and pumpkins and pears  
It was some wonder that in all of her days  
She and El Bucktootho had never crossed ways  

Then one dark dismal day fate dealt her a hand  
Bucky Bucktooth passed by with his bucky buck-pirate band  
With a flourish and a wave and a flash of his blade  
This warning he gave to Cap'n Fluffenwhatnot the brave  
"Beware, be forewarned, be afraid and in doubt  
For all that you are with, you will soon be without"  

She stood stock still in horror aghast at his gaze  
Cap'n Fluffennugen's brain quickly mired in haze  
What "with" did he mean, her crew and her ship?  
And how would this "without" come to happen so quick?  
She stared as he walked, nay he crept down the pier  
What a horrible man to snatch away all she held dear  

She stood there for minutes as he boarded his boat  
Minutes drained into hours as she lost all her hope  
For days in despair Cap'n Fluffenthangs stood on that dock  
And a week passed in seconds tick-tocked by the clock  
For seven long days she moved nary a muscle  
In the midst of the port's busy hustle and bustle  

When she finally awoke from her fear induced coma  
Cap'n Flufflebutter startled to a startling aroma  
Her cargo of fruit was well in to decay  
Her crew all abandoned and went on their way  
She was all by herself; not a cent to her name  
She shed one single tear from frustration and shame  

But that one tiny drop as it slid down her cheek  
Dredged up in the Cap'n something still, silent, and meek  
Her courage and conviction she had managed to keep  
She would reclaim what she'd lost to that deplorable creep  
And Cap'n Fluffaluffagus vowed that she never would sleep  
As long as Bucktooth the Pirate terrorized the deep  

She needed a hand, a friendly friend by her side  
So Cap'n Fluffers did search first far and then wide  
For whom, one would wonder, would be worthy of this?  
This searching the seas, this motoring in mists  
This running and gunning, zip-zooming to find  
The one winged white walleye, the last of his kind  

"Hold on," you might say, surprised at the claim  
"A one winged white walleye? Why that's simply insane  
Walleyes are fish and as fish don't you see  
They have no use for wings as they swim through the sea  
And on this point too, I must declare you're at fault  
For walleyes are green and prefer fresh water to salt"  

My dear listener of course you've hit the nail on the head  
If there were ever such walleyes, then they all must be dead  
but Cap'n Fluffles had heard and had since then believed  
That one, just one walleye, had thus been conceived  
and that one, just one walleye was all she would need  
and for that one walleye she would scour the seas  

She had heard long ago this one walleye did dwell  
In a shack in the shade of a shallow sea shell  
In this hideout he hid out to ride out the storms  
That shook round the sea shell when the shallows would warm  
None knew of his nest, his home he had shroud  
"But find him I must" Cap'n Fluffycakes whispered aloud  

Cap'n Fluff had an idea, a vision of sorts  
She would build a new shelter, a mansion, a fort  
whatever when witnessed would woo one walleye away  
from the leaned over lean-to where that walleye now stayed  
A perfect conclusion, and at once she did start  
And into that home she poured all of her heart  

The place now constructed she spread round the word  
And the walleye secluded, even he heard  
About the fine house Cap'n Flufferberry designed  
and that he alone was the tenant she had in mind  
his curiosity did kill him (but his cat was alright)  
and at once he did leave, this one winged walleye of white  

He arrived at the spot he was told it would be  
This brand new abode built beneath the blue sea  
But no home did he find, no dwelling to dwell in  
No cottage, no condo, no castle, no cabin  
He found not one thing like a house or a hut  
But he did find that louse, Bucktooth the Pirate  

But perhaps one should say that Bucktooth found him  
Since things for the walleye looked quite sour and grim  
For Bucktooth had twisted Cap'n Fluffington's directions  
And led the walleye away from Cap'n Flufflebunny's affections  
And here in the remotest part of the ocean  
Bucktooth planned to destroy the object of her devotion  

But as he drew out his saber to dispatch the white fish  
Cap'n Flufferbell appeared and interrupted his wish  
"I knew you would hurt him, you awful old man  
I knew you would try to hurt me again  
I knew you would lie and he'd get lost on his way  
I knew he would die if you had your day  

"But Bucktooth, oh Bucktooth" Cap'n Fluffylumpkins went on  
"Bucktooth, your pirating days are long gone  
You will now be without as you wished upon me  
You will wander alone as you wander the sea  
You'll never hurt my white walleye with only one wing  
You'll never steal cargo or crew or ships or bling bling  

"For Bucktooth" she said as a tear breached her eye  
"Bucktooth, you are a disgusting, deplorable guy  
You thought your curse robbed me of all that I loved  
But now you see clearly that those things were just stubs  
Filling holes in my heart that this walleye now fills  
For I searched the world over for his scales and his gills"  

Bucktooth stood and he listened to every last word  
And forgot about the white walleye with one wing like a bird  
His mind melted to mush as Cap'n Fluffenfluff finished her spiel  
She left him one last lump of truth in this ordeal  
"All that I was with, I can now live without  
I have this white walleye, through in and throughout"  

"But you sir will wander this world where we stand  
With no one, not one man in your bucky buck-pirate band  
You will only have you, and with you will you be  
Forever alone as you sail on the sea"  
With a sigh she then turned and with the walleye went on  
He watched without moving not an inch till they'd gone  

They say Bucktooth still roams and he moans till this day  
Riding alone on his ship as it breaks through the waves  
He endlessly searches in hopeless pursuit  
He cases the crooks and the crannies to boot  
He looks for a white one winged walleye of his own  
But there is one, only one, and now with the Cap'n, he's home
