Perhaps ironic, perhaps morbid, perhaps downright depressing, but this time of year makes me think of, ponder, and otherwise potificate the many facets and faces of death.  No no, not the movie, just good ol' fashioned say-no-more fare-thee-well.  

In truth, I don't really think too terribly much about death.  But just as weddings make me consider my ideal marriage ceremony, so too do funerals give me pause and reason to consider my own send off.

It seems to me, that for various and sundry reasons a party would be most certainly in order.  Something grand, with a few kegs of Shiner and a couple good bones tables; maybe a live band playing a selection of Texas country favorites.  But I would definitely say a party is most certainly in order.

I'm very confident too that I shouldn't be buried.  I don't want to have a place where my friends and family can go to look at a rock in the ground to remember me.  If it takes some random rock in the ground proudly displaying my name for you to remember me, then I'd really rather you wouldn't bother remembering me at all.

But I am aware that most people need some sort of closure, some closing of the book, an end to the last act.  This is the sort of thing I do spend quite a bit of time considering, and is the focus of my thoughts tonight.

If I pass on a proper burial, that really only leaves cremation.  As urns and ashes make for rather disturbing table decoration, I'd like to have my ashes dispersed somehow.

Perhaps I could have my family install a solid gold commode and be flushed out to sea, the long way.  Maybe I could be mixed into the two kegs of Shiner for my send off celebration and be flushed out to sea, the really long way.  Then again, it would be somewhat amusing to be formed into something about the same shape and consistency as a potato and launched from a PVC cannon.

Maybe instead of being dispersed I could find some more practical use for my ashes.  I think I would make a wonderful serving platter.  Just think, at the next thanksgiving meal, "Could you please pass Uncle Fuwjax?"  Or perhaps I could be turned into a chia pet, "Hey kids, did you remember to water Fuwjax?"

While all of these ideas are inspired, my current favorite is to have my ashes put into fireworks, and at the close of my send off, to truly go out with a bang.
