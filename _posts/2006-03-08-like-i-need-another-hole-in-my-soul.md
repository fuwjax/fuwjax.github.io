So, this past weekend was probably the most incredible weekend I've had in many moons.  I got to see [Blake and Fallon](http://www.blakeandfallon.com/) perform for the first time in months.  I got to have a 3 hour argument with my boss that's been about 3 years overdue.  I got to meet two incredible bands, [Threads](http://www.threadsmusic.com/) and [Burgundy Road](http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=48057056), two sets of guys who are clearly into music and clearly into Jesus Christ.  I found a new bar run by an old friend staffed by a bartender who could actually make me smile.  I even figured out how to make my iPod behave.  Yeah, this weekend was good.

But between the music festival and the mission trip right around the corner and the fun of the bar and the company of good friends, I was weak and tired, stressed and strained when I found myself hanging out at the apartment of some guys involved in the new bonfire.  We got to talking and telling stories and just generally reminiscing and they finally offered to show me a powerpoint slide show.  I'm not sure that I entirely realized I was going to see a slideshow from Bonfire 99, but I don't think I would have agreed to watching it if I had.

So I stood there in my new friend's room, staring at his computer watching the faces of a cherished group of old friends flip past on the screen.  Faces of people I haven't talked to in 6 years.  Some of them were faces of people I won't see again this side of heaven.  And I broke.

I collapsed in the corner of their upstairs landing and shook and cried and basically lost all control over anything and everything.  I sobbed uncontrollably, mumbled unintelligibly, and fought in vain to stop.  Finally I just sat there and rode it out.

When I could finally unclentch my fists and stop crying, I washed my face, went downstairs, offered the guys my apologies and goodbyes, and headed home.  I'm pretty sure they just thought I'd had too much to drink and felt like being emotional.

Truth is, I'm responsible for the deaths of 12 of my closest friends, and I'm responsible for the demise of a cherished tradition and teaching tool.

I've had a lot of people telling me what I need lately.  I need to get a new job.  I need to get a girlfriend.  I need to get a therapist.  I need to get a team of therapists.  I need to get a therapist who's got a team of therapists.

I can tell you what I need.  It's not a job, a woman, or an ear.  I need forgiveness.  I need grace.  I need peace.  I need joy.  I need rest.  I need to breathe.
