*Please read [John 2:1-4](http://biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=50&chapter=2&version=31 "Bible Gateway") before reading this post*

It is the general concensus that the "time" to which Jesus refers is the period of his miracles and ministry.  He had only just called his disciples and had not yet begun performing miracles as proof of his divinity.  Yet at Mary's faith and insistance, he began his miracles before his teaching.

Wait a second, if Mary were truly expecting a miracle, why would she think Jesus needed any helpers?  This sounds more like a mother who knew she could trust her son with the responsibility of going to the winery and getting more wine.

But if that's the case, why would Jesus answer with "My time has not yet come?"  His time to go to the winery?  Certainly the concensus seems more likely than that.  

But then, his answer is still bothersome.  If he knew his time to perform miracles had not yet come, why did he heed Mary's request over God's plan?  No, this cannot be right, the start of his miracles is not the right "time".

Jesus was asked to provide wine for a wedding feast.  Why would he say "My time has not yet come?"  

He came into this world to provide the wine for the wedding feast, not at Cana, but for his marriage to his bride, the church.  And not just to provide the wine, he came to be the wine, to offer his own blood as the wine for that feast.

No his time certainly had not come at the wedding in Cana.  But when his time did come, it began in the same way as this chapter, "On the third day a wedding took place."  This time not at Cana, but at the empty tomb.
