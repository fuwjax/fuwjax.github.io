Two weeks ago, I was driving home from my friend Cade's funeral. I-45 isn't the most exciting road in the land, and I was passing the time telling and retelling the story I intended to record for Cade's wife, which if you're curious, you can find [here](https://youtu.be/kGGl1JqBQ40). I was still trying to nail down how I would end the story, when I was startled from my reverie by a call from the area code I had back when Cade and I were friends.

A number that isn't in my phone usually means spam or a wrong number, but after a funeral the hope of reconnecting with an old friend is completely overwhelming. I just couldn't answer the phone though. The end of that story is pretty intense, and I rarely answer phone calls in tears. I resolved to call the number back when I got home.

And then I forgot. I completely forgot about the call until the following Monday, when I awoke to find I had missed another call from that same number at 11:15 the night before. 11:15 isn't spam. Two 3 second silent voicemails aren't wrong numbers. It's a call from someone who is afraid of being ignored.

Out of curiosity, I looked back through my call log. I tend to treat my call log like a to-do list, so I'm usually good about keeping it clear, but the past month I haven't been as diligent. I was shocked to find a third call in the list with a third silent voicemail.

I remember that call. I was sitting at a table talking with some coworkers. I was surprised to see the old area code, but I get wrong numbers all the time. It was a silent voicemail, obviously a wrong number. Obviously wasn't so obvious any more.

Who could it be? Who would call me during work hours, and then somehow call during my drive home from a funeral, and follow up later that weekend, but never once leave a message.

For a week, I tried to go through my mental roladex, cross-referencing people from the old stomping grounds with people who knew I'd be a wreck that weekend. I can't just call the number, not without having some idea of who might be on the other line. There are plenty of folks I'd love to reconnect with - honestly, I'd love to reconnect with anyone. But I have a tendency to be overly generous in my grief, and there are people from my past willing to take advantage of that.

Finally, I called back. I've heard plenty of automated messages in my life, but this was the first time I'd ever heard "Account number is not valid." Account number? Isn't this a phone number? What account?

Now my curiosity was fired up. If it was an account issue, then the phone records might give some insight. I did a reverse phone look up. Yeah, I know, horrible. I don't have a good excuse. This past weekend I paid to do a background check on someone who felt like I was ignoring them. Talk about your trust issues.

I paid for my report and got an email back that said something to the effect of "Some inquiries require manual intervention, you'll get your report in 24 hours." What about a phone record takes manual intervention?

The next day I got another email. "We're sorry, but we have no information on that phone number." How do you have no information on a phone number that is clearly returning an automated message that is obviously not from the phone company?

I'm pretty sure it will happen when that phone number is owned by a multi-national corporation, like say maybe Microsoft - perhaps as part of a VOIP network that tries to drive down costs by using local area numbers to bypass long distance charges - perhaps something like Skype.

You Skype'd me three times and hung up without leaving a message. To be fair, it's a good idea, since you don't get charged for it. If you call again, this time I'll answer. That churn through my roladex only came up with one name. I want to talk to you.

Keep in mind that my friends will find it very entertaining to call me over Skype now just to taunt me. I don't care. I want to talk to you, KK?
