So, the past few months have been pretty intense for me, which you might have assumed, since I've already had more blog posts in '08 than in all of '07. <br /><br />In the midst of all of this intensity, I feel like I have had a bit of a reawakening. It really did start with that request to come to the aid of a facebook group. I was disgusted with the naive elitist self-righteousness of a group whose sole attraction and qualification was claiming to be Christian. And then I was even more disgusted by the group taking offense when the people explicitly turned away from the group put up substantially more convincing arguments for why the group is populated by naive elitist self-righteous people than the group could muster in its defense.<br /><br />But that was really just the start. For a month I drove past people who were claiming that prayer involved large placards in front of an abortion clinic. That's not faith, it's activism. That's not love, it's stone throwing.<br /><br />Then right before spring break, I had dinner with a group of very cherished old friends. One comment in particular has really stuck with me. One of the families had to leave their old church. They had been very involved, he was part of the music ministry there, and I was surprised to hear that they had transferred. When I pressed him for why, he told me that he started paying attention to what was said during the service. He started listening for the following things:<br /><br />Is Jesus Christ mentioned?<br />If he is, is he the subject of the verbs?<br />What are those verbs?<br /><br />And he found that in his old church, there were days he couldn't even say yes to the first question.<br /><br />Well, all of this had basically built up in me a complete distaste for the kind of Christianity I see on a regular basis. I had reached the point that if I had been given an opportunity to talk to the whole group during one of the evening devotions we have on the mission trip, I was 100% sure what I was going to talk about.<br /><br />I was going to talk all about me.<br /><br />My world is all about me. Worse, my faith is all about me. I ask questions like "Where is God calling me?" or "What are God's plans for me?" I ask God for things he's already given me. I tell him things he already knows. I talk to God like I'm talking to the wall, and I beg him for things like I found him in a oil lamp.<br /><br />In my mind, I can almost see my conversations with God. Distracted and unfocused, I can believe that if he were here right now I would at best be stirred into Martha-mode. If I even bothered to talk with him, more than likely I'd tell him about my day, my week, my month. I'd probably relate a story or two and complain in vivid detail why some aspect of my world isn't revolving just right around me.<br /><br />I'm confident I could stare face to face into the eyes of a God who has done everything to be with me, and I'd just look around him. The world is full of people who reject God because they don't know who he is. I've stood in his presence and ignored him. If I were God, I think I'd rather be around the people who didn't know who I was, than to be around the people who didn't care.<br /><br />But this is our culture. This is post-modern christianity at its finest. We can stand face to face with a God who loves us, and we'd rather have a happy family, financial security, success, or a million other things that don't have anything to do with proclaiming the majesty of a God who loves us so much that he was willing to throw away that majesty to be with us. I know what Eve was thinking when she stared at that fruit. I know exactly what Israel was thinking every time they found another god de jour. I know exactly how self-righteous the Pharasees felt with their stacks of laws.<br /><br />I stood in the middle of my apartment one day trying to come up with a good picture of who God is.
