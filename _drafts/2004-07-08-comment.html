I've been wrestling with the definitions of elitism and prejudism, segregation and classification, and I've gotta tell you, my brain is just about fried.  I do have an opinion, and a strong one at that, but without the definitions I've worked up, I run the risk of just being confusing.  But rather than playing Webster, let's try a slightly different tactic.
<br />
<br />Let's take as our example a man.  This is classification.  He is human and male.  There is nothing wrong with making either of these two assessments and is in fact quite helpful.  Now that I know he's human, I assume we can communicate.
<br />
<br />This is prejudism though.  I'm making an assumption, a judgement call that because this man is in the set called "human" I assume that provides him a spot in the set called "people with whom I can communicate".  I don't think this type of prejudism is necessarily bad, it is however prejudiced.
<br />
<br />But now let's assume this man is deaf, again a classification.  But now that I know he's deaf, I assume we can't communicate.
<br />
<br />Again, this is prejudism, but prejudism doesn't really bother us until it leads to elitism.  The man is definitely in the set of deaf people, but I then assume that knocks him out of the group of people with whom I can communicate.  This is certainly bad.
<br />
<br />Elitism then is the belief that those in a group are better or worse than those outside the group.  In our example, I have assumed deaf people are lower than those who aren't deaf.  If they weren't deaf, I could communicate with them, but as it is, I cannot.
<br />
<br />Elitism then leads to segregation which is the separation of those in a group from those outside the group.  So in this instance, I believe I can't communicate with deaf people is the elitism, I don't communicate with deaf people is the segregation.
<br />
<br />Now, let's look at another example.  I pass a person in the hall at work who is not wearing a name badge.  I assume they don't work here.  I know some classified information which I can and should share with people I work with, but I do not share it with this person.  All of the aspects are here, I classified him as a non-badge wearing person.  I prejudicially decide he is not a fellow employee.  I believe there is some information that only those elite fellow employees should recieve.  And I segregate this man into the people whom I did not tell this information.
<br />
<br />So I did all the things Dr. Seuss said I shouldn't do, and I keep my job.
<br />
<br />We do all these things daily to varying degrees, and we do this because it's how we were built.
<br />
<br />So classification is a verifyable 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Elitism then leads to segregation, 
<br />
<br />Both instances were examples of prejudism.  I assumed we could communicate when I found out he was a human, even though I cannot communicate with all people, and that we can't communicate because he's deaf, even though we'll probably be able to communicate just fine.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />I am completely sure that communication is 
<br />
<br />But prejudism isn't bad.  It's ok to assume we can't communicate.  What is bad is then not trying to communicate.  
<br />
<br />When I lived in Dallas I assumed that one of the drivers there would make sure I wouldn't make it to work alive.  I still drove to work.  
<br />
<br />This is prejudism.  I cannot in fact communicate with all humans, and fair chance is probably an exageration.  But again, I'm trying to show that prejudism is not a horrible thing.  Yes, you are making a judgement call before you have all the facts, but 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Classification: determining the extent to which someone is in a group.
<br />
<br />Prejudice: assigning qualities to a member of a group which are not necessary for qualification as members of the group.
<br />
<br />Elitism: giving a subgroup of the 
<br />
<br />Growing up, Dr. Seuss was perhaps one of my most influential teachers.  His wisdom, conveyed in his prosoetry, transcended entertainment and education, a verbal halucenogenic which took me and children like me on a wild ride of human empiricalism fully packaged and illustrated.
<br />
<br />"Star Bellied Sneetches", his work on human prejudice, segregation and elitism, perhaps shaped my views on the subject single handedly.  I have reached a conclusion however that I cannot put away.  Humans will, by our nature cluster into groups.  Whether we want to group or want to avoid the group, there is simply no way around it.  We will always be able to say "There are two kinds of people" and then fill in the blank to our hearts delight.
<br />
<br />But for the moment I'm not interested in groups, I'm interested in me and my perception, because at its root, prejudice is making a judgement call based on your perception before hearing the facts.  And since we're talking about perception, let's take someone who from my point of view is not capable of percieving the world in the way I percieve it, and so, perhaps, let us take a deaf man as our case study.
<br />
<br />He is deaf, there is nothing wrong with classifying him as such, for that is all we're doing.  Classification is a terribly useful thing.  If I don't classify him as deaf, I'll probably keep trying to talk to him, which may be as futile as frustrating.
<br />
<br />But you see, this is prejudism.  Deaf means you can't hear.  It is a physical thing.  When discussing deafness, there are people who are deaf, people who aren't and lots of people in between.  Just because this man is deaf however doesn't mean that talking to him is futile.  This is prejudism.  I have classified him, and then based on my perception
<br />
<br />I would like to spin this particular ball a bit and take a look at elitism from what is in my opinion a different angle.  Often we talk about the prejudism, segregation and elitism inflicted on one group by members of what is perceieved as the opposite group.  We talk of racial discrimination, conservatism vs. liberalism, Communism vs Capitalism, etc.  But we will not concern ourselves with this.  We will instead enter into my virtual matrix-esque world.  An empty world which will remain that way until we choose to bring something else in.
<br />
<br />So here we are, you and I and nothing else.  There must by definition be some decisions made, each of us of the other, before any interaction of worth can occur.  We will both likely very quickly and subconsciously decide that we are of course human.  Hardly a surprising conclusion, but as we both know, there are two kinds of people, those who are, and those who aren't.
<br />
<br />This quick, subconscious decision is called classification.  There is nothing wrong with classification, and even if there were, I assure you, we are powerless to distill perception from classification.  If you didn't want to classify me as human, you would have to not notice my humanity, and quite frankly, if there's just you and me and nothing else in our contrived world, and you failed to notice my humanity, I would honestly start to doubt your own.
<br />
<br />This by the way is prejudism.  I have classified you as a human being unable to percieve.  The classification is fair, the assumption that because you are unable through choice or circumstance to percieve the world, you are somehow not a human, this is wrong.  To classify a man as blind is fair, to deem him less of a man because of it is wrong.
<br />
<br />But because you cannot percieve me in the way I expect a fellow human to percieve, and have then exposed my prejudism
