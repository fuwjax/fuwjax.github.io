an ill-fated love destined to fail
<br /> two star-crossed lovers tryin' to ride that comet's tail
<br /> we held on to hope when we couldn't hold each other
<br /> now that hope is gone and I'm starin' at another
<br /> 
<br /> Chorus:
<br /> I'm holdin' out for you
<br /> because no one else will do
<br /> so I'll keep holdin' out
<br /> I'm holdin' out
<br /> I'll keep holdin' out for you
<br /> 
<br /> when I stepped off the shuttle, you can imagine my surprise
<br /> she held out that cup with a blank look in her eyes
<br /> she asked lots of questions and did her best to make me feel
<br /> her care for me wasn't just a job, but what we had was real
<br /> 
<br /> Chorus
<br /> 
<br /> This woman who's taken your place in my life
<br /> can never do what you did to make everything alright
<br /> so I swear right now I'll never again pee in a cup
<br /> I miss the way you touched me when enough was enough
<br /> 
<br /> I'm holdin' it for you
<br /> This pain in my bladder, is tearin' me in two
<br /> but I'll keep holdin' it
<br /> I'm holdin' it
<br /> I'll keep holdin' it for you
