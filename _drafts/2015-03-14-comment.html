I collect the weird and the wise and the wonderful. All the little weird and wise and wonderful bits sit in a pile in my brain where I meticulously catalog and display them. I don't have brain shelves or brain cabinets, that's just silliness. I have stories. I take the weird and wise and wonderful bits and inject them into my stories. My stories are not a library of my accomplishments, they're a museum for everything beautiful I've ever encountered.<br /><br />I'll tell you a story, if you're lucky. I'll also tell you a story if you're not lucky, though I have to warn you, I won't be very into it. My stories rely on a surprising amount of luck on the part of the listener. The lucky will have the feeling of having uncovered a wondrous island full of interesting flora and fauna and an indigenous people with the most delightful traditions and culture. The unlucky will have every reason to believe Dante missed a circle or two.<br /><br />Most of these stories truly did happen though I do take some liberties when choosing them as boxes for my collection. Some stories work better as lids on stories they otherwise have no business being connected to.
