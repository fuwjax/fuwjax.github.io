- comment: Sorry to inject a bit of reality (ouch - the stuff stings) into the conversation, but isn't Fuwjax one of the FEW people who looked the way he does because he is NOT trying to conform? Weekend road warriors don't rebel, they switch. And height is not a woman-related quality. I'd wear stilts or cut my feet off if I thought it would get me a date. No, I'm just looking for a woman who is not scared of me. I mean, come on! The dark hordes of demons that hound me aren't MY fault!

- comment: I think you're sort of implying that L is not already our Queen, which quite frankly is a pretty good way of getting cast out of society whether we midgitify everyone or not.

- comment: Would that make Lindsay our queen? and if so, would I be cast out of society?! Great. Yet another reason to hate on tall girls. Thanks, Fuwjax! anti-yours, T

  Look, is it really my fault that I'm of the opinion that the little people are just more inherently useful than the rest of us? In fact, if it were possible, I think we should genetically alter all babies to be midgets. Just think of it... You're at a baseball game and everyone in the row in front of you stands up, but you don't have to; you can see over them just fine. Or you're crowd surfing at a concert and you're dropped to the ground, but you only fall about 3 feet. You're cleaning out your closet, and you decide it's finally time to throw away that jacket you've had since 4th grade. Imagine the impact on our economy and ecology. We could build our houses half as high, skyscrapers could have twice as many floors. We could have much smaller cars, which would dramatically reduce the effects of rush hour. Let's face it people, midgets aren't freaks or mistakes, they're the future. We're witnessing human evolution here people. on WYSINWYG

  I'd say the blue jeans, black boots, belt and t-shirt, long hair, and a chain coming out of your pocket had less to do with your being percieved as a social deviant than the fact that you're a social deviant. At least this is what the lovely people behind us at dinner would have assumed after listening to your "101 uses for the vertically challenged". on WYSINWYG

  Disturbing? no, of course not... Offensive? definitely. (who wasn't expecting a symantic debate?) And is it more offensive that I was trying to be offensive? Oh I most certainly hope so. It is the impact, or at least the impulse which breaks bones... and information has had far more of an impact than any stick, excepting perhaps a particular one on a particular hill, and it has required more impulse than any snake, excepting perhaps a particular one in a particular garden. As for stones... You know what they say... You can't keep a good man down... Especially a really good man... Even with a really really big stone. Really. on Snakes and Stones may break my Bones

  Contrary to public opinion, I actually never taught class or held office hours drunk, so remembering the story was actually quite easy. And make no mistake, I'm still teaching math, I'm just not paid as well. on TNT: We Know Strippers

  A birth certificate proves who I am, and whose I am. It is nothing but love, a love so deep and rich that I have been claimed and named. A birth certificate is very much a welcome mat, but where a welcome mat just says "Welcome to my home; wipe your feet, would you?" a birth certificate says "Welcome to the family that's been waiting for you." on What is the Bible?

  Was our anti-relationship really so anti-short? It didn't seem that long, though that is much to be expected as anti-time does fly. It is truly a shame that the only things really real about our anti-relationship were the eggs that came between us and the pain that filled the void the eggs left behind. Ah, and the story... always the story. on A Tale of Two Weddings

  It is that desire to learn... that firm belief that no obstacle is insurmountable... that tiny flame that burns somewhere deep in our minds, in our hearts and in our souls that longs to consume the unknown in a fitful, frightful pursuit of knowledge and understanding... it is that motivation that I hope to have instilled and distilled in my students. I am proud of all of my students' successes, a word which I will somewhat arbitrarily define as "that state in which you now find yourself." And I hope success chases you while you chase the truth. on Innumeracy

  I can't rember where, but recently I heard a 'soul brother' sounding narrator reading: "...words like stones CAN break bones..." and I about threw up. Which reinterprets my recollection somewhat: "Staffs and stones may break my bones, but information can only make me nauseous." Since the ancient days of Egypt are long past, snakes and staffs no longer seem interchangeable; they weren't terribly interchangeable even then. Today, snakes and information seem more interchangeable, on a semantic level at least. Which brings me to my main comment: This title is disturbing, when placed in context with the content of your blog. Come to think of it, so was the title of your previous blog. I am curious to know if this was intentional. Can a man know what is most disturbing about himself? If he intended to be disturbing, then the intent to be disturbing would be more so, I submit. on Snakes and Stones may break my Bones

  Mike, I cannot express to you how wonderful this story is. Thank you for enriching my evening, and I am so glad that you remembered the story well enough to retell it later. And thank you for not teaching math anymore. --Jason on TNT: We Know Strippers

  reading that just took me back to your classroom. Sitting on the front row, in heldenfelds (or how ever the hell that name was spelled). It was your class, more likely the large amount of hours in your office that made me for the first time appriciate math. i struggled through and barley passed, yet that was the one class i didn't mind going to. dang that was 4 years ago, i hadn't thought about that since. Actually it was time in your office that inspired this blog name. Talking about Tonka trucks (with personalized licence plates) and shrinky dinks. well this has all been very random. on Innumeracy

  I actually think the analogy works better as the welcome mat. Once you're inside, you know you're welcome, you don't need to have the reminder anymore. The birth certificate is always there and all it says is you're alive after this date. There's no love, just a fact. on What is the Bible?

  You know, I anti-dated you for a year...or so, and you never shared a story as funny as that one. If I wasn't laughing so hard, I'd probably be as upset at you for not sharing as the day I broke up with you. on A Tale of Two Weddings
