I found myself at the top of a slight rise staring down at a large tree covered in brambles and thickets and vines at the edge of a broad clearing. It was one of those surreal moments whose surreal-ness stems exclusively from the fact that there is absolutely nothing surreal about the moment. I had forgotten, in the void of the moment, where I was going, where I had come from, why I had stopped, or for how long. There was only this awkward instant, and with it, the desire to move awkwardly to the next as quickly as possible.<br /><br />Many trees instill in us a desire to act. Have you ever seen a redwood without also taking a picture? We pick oranges from orange trees; we rest under willows. You can climb up a cypress or cut down an oak. This tree too evoked an action. It called out, almost screamed...<br /><br />Hug me.<br /><br />I don't know if you've ever seen a tree that beckoned embrace. I certainly haven't; at least, I don't remember having forgotten in this moment an equally surreal memory. Please don't think I mean to imply that the tree looked like it needed a hug or demanded a hug or even expected a hug. It seemed as though it existed for the sake of hugging. I did what any rational human being would have done. I did exactly what you would have done.<br /><br />I stood there staring at the tree.<br /><br />I know I did. I stood there. Right over there. I'd point, but my arms are somehow entangled in a mass of bark and vine. I'm a little confused how I got here, but it's obvious I had to work to get here. My arms are scratched. My shirt is ripped in a couple places. My hands feel like they're raw if not bleeding. I'm pretty sure I lost a shoe. What should feel distinctly heel-like is almost certainly a root. I'm a little hazy on how this hug started, but I'm quite obviously in it now.<br /><br />In hindsight, it had always been safe to assume that the warmth of a hug came from holding the other person close to you. Warmth is, I suppose, just energy, and trees do spend all day soaking up energy. Maybe it shouldn't be so surprising to find warmth in the embrace of a tree. If you can call it an embrace. It's not like the tree hugged me back. I had to wrestle my way into its branches. They are tight around me, this mass of brambles and thickets and vines the tree had built up to insulate it from everything it feared and desired most.<br /><br />It wasn't really a hug, I kept telling my self... I keep telling myself. Hugs have to be something else, something different. But they can't be something better. The tree whispered to me. It shifted with the breeze. It did not release its hold on me, even as I let go. Wrestling my way out was even more difficult than getting in, judging by my arms and my clothes. I never liked those shoes anyway.<br /><br />I found myself walking further into the clearing, knowing the tree was behind and off to my left. I didn't turn to look back, though I felt like it watched me the whole way - not judging, not even feeling, just watching. I didn't even notice the little tree
