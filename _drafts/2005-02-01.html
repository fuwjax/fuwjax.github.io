I am dumbstruck by the whirlwind of my life.  I sometimes speak of life's hills and valleys as though I'm on a train ride, but that completely ignores the fact that far too often I'm trying desperately to derail that train, or throw everything of worth from it.  But in the midst of my mischief I have stumbled back upon this one simple truth.  I live a life I do not deserve.
<br />
<br />My friends, it is with the sincerest heart that I tell you that those things in my life have nothing to do with my computer or my job.  My worthlessness is not evident in my wardrobe or my cd collection.  Not even my mom's jeep can detail the extent to which I am blessed beyond measure.  All of these things are tiny triffles to the gifts that I have been given by my Father through his son, and through you.
<br />
<br />He did prove once and for all that He loves me beyond measure with his sacrifice.  His blood has washed me clean, there is no way to deserve such a gift.  It must be, and in fact was, given without regard to the inadaquacy of the recipient... of me.
<br />
<br />But He didn't stop there, in his infinite wisdom he gave me you, so that we could encourage and support one another in the one true faith.  This is no small matter, and a gift I pray I never take for granted.
