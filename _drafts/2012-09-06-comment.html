I love to think about what people say, to truly meditate on it. Over the past month or so, four statements have been rattling around in my head; this is but a poor attempt to purge them from my skull and return to my normal crazy thoughts.<br /><br />"Follow Your Passion"<br /><br />This could very well be the most evil thing anyone has ever said to me. This is tantamount to asking WOPR to play tic-tac-toe. I have no idea what my passion is, whether or not I follow it, or how I would if I don't. &nbsp;I am relatively incapable of even deciding what I desire; how could passion be anything more than a word to me?<br /><br />But I've thought about it, and I'm fairly certain there are exactly two things that bring me any joy in this life: trading stories and enabling someone else to pursue their passion. I'd say I'm pretty rigorous about following the first. The second one is tough, since it implies a certain amount of trust combined with a certain amount of detached disinterest. At the very least I feel relatively confident that it's not the sort of thing one can follow in the traditional sense.<br /><br />Then again, maybe my passion is talking about God, ranting about my annoyance de jour, or writing random thoughts down for a dozen folks to peruse on their lunch break... You're very welcome.<br /><br />So, I'm pretty certain that to the extent I can follow my passion, I do. To be honest though, w<span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(175, 192, 227, 0.230469); -webkit-composition-frame-color: rgba(77, 128, 180, 0.230469); -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875);">hen this came up in conversation, my first thought was, "That's silly, what would I do in Temple?"</span><br /><br />"You have to take care of yourself"<br /><br />If I could even start to list all the reasons this is a universally silly thing to say to me, I would have to publish it in several volumes. At my age, it's a bit ridiculous to start now.<br /><br />This particular instance, the sentiment arose out of someone's frustration that I would consider doing something I don't want to do solely for the sake of someone else. It's tough to explain that the only thing that you enjoy is someone else's enjoyment, and that sometimes it's even sweeter when that someone else doesn't even know the reason you're doing it or just how much it hurts.<br /><br />I understand that it's difficult to understand why someone would chase failure as hard as I do. To be fair, it isn't about chasing failure as much as it is about taking risks. I firmly believe that risk has to be an integral part of your life, if only to prove to yourself that you're still alive. In my world, "care" is the opposite of risk; I'm simply incapable of taking care of myself.<br /><br />"It's not your fault"<br /><br />Funny thing about forgiveness. It doesn't take away the consequences, just the guilt. It doesn't make me less responsible, it only lets me sleep at night. I am to blame for the deaths of twelve of my friends. I'm not looking for pity; I say it simply because it's true. I'm ashamed; of course I'm ashamed. I'm ashamed of a large number of the events in my stories. I don't tell my stories because I'm proud of them. I tell stories because they demand to be told.<br /><br />I take responsibility for my action and inaction. You're missing the whole point of the story if you try to make excuses for me.<br /><br />"Do you miss Ashley?"<br /><br />Yes. Far more than I want to admit and more than I have the right to. I am well accustomed to the act of sending, of giving up my first joy for the sake of the second. You'd think that by now I would have also become accustomed to the loss. That's what I thought too; I guess we're both wrong.<br /><br />I struggle a lot with the concept of missing someone. It seems a decidedly broken way of life. "Missing" makes the past out to be greater than the present, a preference for fantasy over reality. While I would generally be opposed to wanting what you do not and cannot have, I find myself wishing from time to time that I could have a mind blowing conversation or two.
