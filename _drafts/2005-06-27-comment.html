A friend of mine asked me to speak on unity at a retreat in a few months.  That's it, just unity.  Not some aspect of unity, no subtitle, no context.  Unity.<br /><br />It's hardly the most unusual topic I've been given.  It's not the broadest.  It's not even the most abstract.  What makes me laugh is that the person who asked me to speak doesn't understand that I never say what people think I'm going to say.  <br /><br />Before I go on, I would just like to say that I have never understood why people don't know what I'm going to say.  I'm fairly predictable in my own head.  My belief structure is terribly simple.  I believe God doesn't lie, and in whatever ways I think I'm good, he's better.  I believe that I don't deserve anything I've been given, that I make beautiful things ugly.  I believe that it's all about the Y, the underlying motivation, the source of all your "why"'s, that thing that generates all your reasons for doing what you do, thinking what you think, saying what you say.  I believe the only Y I can have on my own is "I".  I believe that by the grace of God, he has opened the door to give us some thing other than "I" for our Y; he offers his own son.  I believe that because God is now my Y that he has marked me as his own, with all the promises and rights therein.  I believe that I'm spending eternity with him.  I believe that when he said to "store up for yourselves treasures in heaven" we're supposed to do the same thing he did, that you are my treasure just as we are his treasure.  Given that, I'd say it's pretty easy to predict every word that comes out of my mouth.<br /><br />But that's not the point.  The point is unity.
