So a friend of mine recently told me of a debate he'd been having with a coworker.  The debate was over free will vs. determinism.  His coworker claimed that free will was just an illusion, that our actions are predetermined and that if we had more information we could completely predict everything that has happened and will happen.
<br />
<br />A <a href="http://ccwf.cc.utexas.edu/~govind/stories/finitude.html">website</a> I was reading in trying to respond to another email this same friend sent me talked about the illusion of time.  To quote him:
<br />
<br /><blockquote>Why must time be linear and real? I hope that I have shown, through one or both of my arguments, that Craig assumes the linearity and real existence of time as fact without any real support for these assumptions.</blockquote>
<br />
<br />Assuming the linearity and real existence of time is fact is an assumption all of us make all the time.  "Wow, I really can't wait to see you last week."  "I love our weekly meetings, see you again in two days."  Don't get me wrong, I've said stuff like that, but rest assured that the root cause is not the nonlinearity of time but just my own retardedness.
<br />
<br />And I bet there is no end to all of the quotes one could dig up on the illusion of life.  In fact, I'm going to go try right now...
<br />
<br />My friends I want you to know that I have just found a horrible site in my search for quotes.  A site that scares me to the depths of who I am.  
<br />
<br />I have always claimed that I say things that people might think.  I sometimes say crazy things, sometimes mean things, but my intention is to always get people to think about things they haven't bothered to think about before.  Things I think are important; things I think are real.
<br />
<br />Please I beg you.  Test me.  Open your bible.  Judge for yourself whether my words are my own or of God.  Those that are of my own, discard and dismiss them, and never think of such things again.
<br />
<br />I am stunned by the words I just read, of the thoughts of a man who pulled more verses from the bible than most pastors do for a sunday morning sermon.  His disagreements with the truth were subtle and he brought them together convincingly.
