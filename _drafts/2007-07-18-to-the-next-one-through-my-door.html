Hi<br /><br />It's really nice to meet you.<br /><br />Before we sit down, there's a few things you should know.  In just a little bit, we're literally going to have the best conversation of your life. At least, it'll start out that way. We'll laugh so hard while swapping stories about our past. We'll talk about what we like, what we love, what we miss, what we lost. I'll ask you about your family, your job, your childhood, your home. We'll share tiny slivers of our private secret lives, just enough to gauge how likely it will be to one day develop the trust it would take to tell the whole story. All in all a richly satisfying experience.<br /><br />But along the way, I'm going to slowly, deliberately convince you that this is the last conversation you should ever have with me.  I'll tell you about how I've hurt past girlfriends; how I am emotionally stunted, sexually inexperienced, mentally unstable. But I'll do all this in such a way that you won't know how or what to believe. It will be confusing; you'll have to connect many of the dots yourself and it won't make any identifiable picture when you've finished. And the end result is that, if everything goes according to plan, you'll be exactly at arms length.<br /><br />I want you to be interested in me, but I want that interest to be academic. I want you to find me engaging but not attractive; witty but not hysterical; intelligent but not informed. I want you to want to talk to me, but have no idea what to talk about. I want you to want to be near me, but have no idea what we'd do. I want you to think we have lots in common, but on closer investigation, find nothing in common at all.<br /><br />I'm going to do this to you because this is exactly what I want from you. I want an aquaintance with no room for expectations, no hope of future growth. A static frozen relationship that can be picked up or dropped off with as little interruption to my life as possible. I've had people in the past call it a friendship of convenience. That's not it at all, it's neither a friendship nor convenient. It's terribly difficult work to paint myself as boring and uninspiring, you should be thankful I'm going to such great lengths for you.<br /><br />And don't get me wrong, none of this is fake or a game. It's a very elaborate defense mechanism built precisely for you. If I don't keep you at arms length, I'll try to consume you. I'll learn to measure your responses and predict your reactions. I'll learn your weaknesses, your fears, your reservations, and I'll push them all to their breaking point.  I'll become an intense addiction. Your friends will hate me, and hate you for defending me.
