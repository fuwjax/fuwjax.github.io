Sure, kid, I'll tell you a story. You know, there aren't many things that make being a super hero better than being just your run-of-the-mill garden variety hero, but stories are one of them. Most heroes just have the one story. With a super, stories are more like your paycheck, your retirement plan. Get enough of them, and you're set for the rest of your life, however short that might be.<br /><br />No, you're right, by any and all accounts, I'm old. Old enough that I've got just about any story you might want to hear. There's the time I saved myself and a squad of elite Fly Soldiers of Bugatraz VII from the Terrorantula (look, kid, I don't make the names up, I'm just the good guy). I've got a few good ones about my encounters with my best friend turned arch nemesis, John Baxter a.k.a. Jacque en the Baques. And there are several, I'm quite happy to say, about my adventures with Anne Treel, who after we retired went from being my sidekick Miss Communication to my wife of far too few and far too confusing years.<br /><br />None of those? Not what you're looking for? Now look here, kid, supers aren't like normal heroes. Heroes always blather on about once when they were in the right place at the right time and they did the right thing for the right people and it all worked out cleanly and happily ever after. That's not how super hero stories end. That's not how they start either, and there's not even any of that in the middle.<br /><br />Super hero stories start out ugly and get uglier on the way to a half-resoltuion that gets even worse in the continuation. Heroes do everything right once; supers do the best they can with what they got, stand up in the wreckage and the flames and the anguish, shake the dust off their feet, rinse and repeat. Heroes get the girl and the parade and the pat on the back. Supers get to watch their best friends die or turn against them while technology, nature, aliens, and pretty much anything and everything else gets hurled...<br /><br />Fine, kid, fine. What do you want to hear? The worst? No, Jacque wasn't the worst villain I ever faced, not by a long shot.
