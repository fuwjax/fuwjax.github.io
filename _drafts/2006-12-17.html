I hate feelings I can't control.  They completely disgust me.  I'm not even talking about rage or lust here.  Lots of people hate those.  I'm talking about pretty much anything. If I get to where I like something to much, I stop going anywhere near it.  I stopped listening to <a href="http://pandora.com">pandora</a> because I spent so much time trying to configure the perfect station for it.  I've given up Dr. Pepper before, not for lent, but because I've actually told people not to talk to me in the morning before I've had one or two.<br /><br />This isn't about enjoyment. As long as I enjoy it, it's still something I control. Adicts don't enjoy doing their drug, they need to do their drug. It's not about feeling good when they're on it.  They don't feel anything when they're on it, it's about not feeling all the other stuff they can't help but feel when they're not high.<br /><br />So basically, it works like this.  If I'm not around it, but I'm thinking about it, I'm disgusted.  And it doesn't matter what "it" is.  I just want it gone, because eventually I'll stop thinking about it.  It doesn't even matter what those thoughts are like.  They could be euphoric and I doubt it would matter.
