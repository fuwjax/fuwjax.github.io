Most people say variety is the spice of life.  Some people say diversity is the spice of life.  Some people claim it's change.  There are tons of websites selling food, coffee, oils under the guise of the spice of life.<br /><br />For me, epiphany is the spice of life.<br /><br />A new perspective, a new idea, a new light turning on in a previously dark part of the depths of my mind, this is the delightful part of my world.<br /><br />But I have to say the well of revelation has been dry for me for far too long.  My life is bland and flavorless.  I have pointless and silly debates with my friends.  I tell stories that everyone I know has heard a million times because they're a million years old.  I don't want to talk about things I've talked about before.  I want to make new memories not rehash old ones.<br /><br />I keep blaming the blandness of my life on where I am, but the truth is I am where I am because I am living blandly.<br /><br />I chase everything but the spice of my life.  I don't chase the truth any more.  I chased a girl.  I chased a job.  I've chased just about anything and everything I could find.  I mourn the past as though it was better than my present.<br /><br />I<br /><br />There was a time when I spoke often of my world.  My world is a fairly interesting place.  The grass is still green.  The sky is still blue.  Everything is exactly the same as it is in the real world, the only exception is me.  I'm not in my own world.<br /><br />It's an unusual perspective, living on the outside.  Certain things cease being so important.  Things like wants and pains.  I won't for a second claim that I didn't want or hurt back when I used to speak of my world.  But you see them for what they are.<br /><br />When I want something it is because of a hole in my life.  There are lots of reasons I want a new job, but the biggest is because I can't follow my boss.  We don't share the same vision for our product.  I really want a boss I can follow.<br /><br />I really want to work for someone worth following because I'm not following the man who is worth following even to death.<br /><br />There are lots of reasons I want a wife, but the biggest is because I want someone who encourages me to be a better man.  I long for someone to help me change the world.<br /><br />I really want someone to believe in me, to believe I can impact the world because I fight with my last breath the God who has promised he will do great things through me.<br /><br />There are huge holes in my life, and my wants help me identify them.  It doesn't mean I need a new job, it just means I need to remember what my real job is.  It doesn't mean I need a wife, it just means I need to remember that the support I need ultimately comes from God no matter how he manifests it in my life.
