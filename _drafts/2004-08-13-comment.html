I love being me.  Even when my roller coaster life is just sitting in the station waiting for the next green light, I love being me.  I'm proud to be an Aggie, a Texan, an American, a Lutheran and a Bonfire Dead.  But most of all, I'm proud to be me.  I'm not saying I haven't made more than my fair share of mistakes, I'm just saying all the mistakes I made were mine, and I don't want to give any of them up.  It's more important to me that they were mine than that they were mistakes.
<br />
<br />It's hard to be an Aggie and see how much has been lost in the last 5 years at this university.  It's hard to be a Texan and watch the identity of rural Texas melt away in the heat of the lights of the city.  It's hard to be an American and listen to a government completely devoid of good role models.  It's hard to be a Lutheran and bear the weight of the division that plagues our synod.  It's hard to be a Bonfire Dead and still be alive.  It's hard, but it's a difficultly worth embracing.
<br />
<br />The reason membership in each of these groups is so difficult is because pretty much anyone can be a member, and from my point of view, no one is willing to live up to the expectations associated with membership.
<br />
<br />I remember one of my freshmen, way back in the day, asked to talk to me about how disillusioned she'd become in the first two months of school.  When she came to A&M, she expected everyone to say howdy to her, but it was rare that someone did.  She expected everyone to respect the grass and the men whose sacrifice we remembered by staying off the grass, but there were plenty of people who didn't respect either.
<br />
<br />My response to her, and my response to myself when others do not live up to my expectations for membership, was this.  You can't expect other people to live up to your ideal, but you can give everyone the right to expect such behavior from you. 
<br />
<br />I can't expect everyone on this campus to say howdy as they walk by.  I can expect it from myself.  I can't expect everyone to show their love for this state or this country in the same way I do, in fact, I can't even expect everyone to love them.  But I can expect to show everyone that I'm proud to be a Texan and honored to be an American.  And perhaps more importantly, I can offer you the right to expect me to show you that I love my school, my state, my country, my God, my past, and my family, even if I don't offer you the right to expect how I show it.
<br />
<br />It's a strange line, and I doubt I am doing it justice.  If I expect you to behave as I do becuase you love what I do, I am being unfair.  I love this school, and so I wear this ring with pride.  But it is unfair for me to expect you to wear this ring, and unfair for me to judge your love lacking just because you don't.  I don't wear marroon to the football games, it might be easy to claim I'm a lesser Aggie because of it.  But I can assure you, that there is little correlation between the amount of marroon in the cotton you wear and the marroon coursing through your veins.
