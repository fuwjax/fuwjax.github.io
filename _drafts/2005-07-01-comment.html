People these days seem to think I'm pretty misogenistic.  The problem isn't that I don't like women, it's that I don't like people.  To be fair that's not even the problem; I just really don't like emotions, I don't trust desires, and I couldn't care less about warm fuzzies.<br /><br />A friend of mine told me recently that she used to want to date me.  The underlying implication of course is that I screwed that up somehow, which really only serves to show that I don't particularly care.<br /><br />Another friend of mine told me that our relationship was getting awkward because she wasn't sure what I wanted.  I've realized two things from that conversation.  The first is that I absolutely adore this woman; her smile, her laugh, her conversation, her touch are treasures to be guarded and protected with every ounce of strength in me.  The second is that I don't particularly care.<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong.  I care about these women deeply.  I  just don't particularly care about their emotions or desires or making sure their fuzzy stays warm.  At least, I don't particularly care about their emotions or desires with respect to me.  <br /><br />I am perfectly content doing my part to make these women feel all warm and fuzzy when they're around.  Truth is, sometimes I think that's really the only reason women let us anywhere near them, just to balance their emotions, fulfill their desires, and leave them slightly warmer and a little fuzzier.<br /><br />But I have to admit, I don't trust people who want to do the same for me.
