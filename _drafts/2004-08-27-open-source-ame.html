Cabbage say, I wrote a book, a fairly long book.  And cabbage say, it's a book on something fun... how about space flight.  In this book I put everything there is to know about space flight, keppler's equations, heat transfer, gravity, the vaccum of space, the vaccuum of space toilets, you name it, it's in there.  
<br />
<br />
<br />But I decide that I really want to limit how you use my book and to whom the book is useful, so I glue together most of the pages except for the section on weightlessness and the relationship between gravity and acceleration.  So I'm going to try to market my book to the casual space traveler.
<br />
<br />Lo and behold, my book sells like wildfire.  I'm not entirely where the wildfire market is, or what sort of prices wildfire would fetch, but I bet it's big, real big.  Sure the casual space traveler thinks my book is quite big and bulky, but it tells him what he needs to know, and he's as happy as an ant with a bread crumb.
<br />
<br />Now, there's information in that book that's potentially useful to lots of different people for lots of different reasons, but I'm not particularly worried about them right now.  Maybe one day I'll write another book that'll make the wildfire list in their particular field, but then again, maybe I won't.
<br />
<br />Now, you might be asking, why did I bother glueing the pages together?  Well, it turns out that gluing pages together is part of the book binding process.  And this way I get to decide who uses my book and how.
<br />
<br />Alright, enough with the analogy, I think we can get on with it.

<br />Open source software doesn't mean I'm giving away my software.  It just means I'm giving away how I did what I did.
