I have pondered for years what exactly God might have meant when he said "Let us make mankind in our image." It's funny, if you were to try to research it at all, you'd find an awful lot of people stressing out over the use of the word "us" and not a lot of people interested in the use of "image." It turns out that it's pretty likely the plural possessive is just how hypotheticals were phrased in the early old testament. Just like today we might say "Let's see... I'll have the peanut butter and salami sandwich." "Let's" is a contraction of "Let us," and no one freaks out about that. But "image," now that's an interesting idea. What's that mean?<br /><br />This came up most recently in the context of what's turning out to be a very long post on the god of evolution. Image could mean so many things, and yet none of them feel very worth saying. I mean, if I was God I don't think I'd bother saying "let's make an animal with eyes and a nose just like mine," given the large number of animals that are pretty close eye-and-nose-ily already. And if it meant "walk upright and have opposable thumbs," again, that just seems kinda silly. It's not like Genesis 1 is all that big on detail. We don't read "let us separate the waters from the land because even though it's fun to splash around in, I think I'd like the way sand feels between my toes."<br /><br />I really want to believe God is saying something worth saying, that he's about to make something that he hadn't made before, something very different. And that difference is explicitly going to be that man&nbsp;<i>looks</i> like him. Well, what does that mean? How did we look like God? Do we still look like God?<br /><br />So, maybe I'm giving away a lot about my long post, but I think that God might be quite a bit different than we've been lead to believe. Not by or from the bible, I think that's dead on. But by all the stuff we say and do that has nothing to do with God - Christianese, a friend of mine calls it. I think, as I will hopefully soon outline if I ever get around to finishing what has turned out to be an opus, that this God created us specifically to create <i>with</i> us. And I think that in order for us to do that in any even remotely effective way, we had to <i>look</i> like him. In particular, I think we are literally images of the trinity. No, not figuratively; I literally mean literally. Just because you read the Oatmeal once doesn't suddenly make you a grammar guru.<br /><br />So, for the sake of argument, I'm going to just pick 3 words: body, mind, and heart. I'm picking them carefully; you'll see in a little while why I'm not going to pick "spirit" or "soul" instead of "heart" or for that matter "mind". Let's walk through them quickly to get a better understanding of what I'm trying to get at.<br /><br />Body is how you sense creation. It's light and dark, hot and cold, pressure - it's the way that the physics of creation communicates back to you. Mind is how you interpret creation. It's good and bad, right and wrong, motivation - it's the way that you rationalize and order the meaning of creation. Heart is how you relate to creation. It's joy and peace, anger and despair, longing - it's the way that creation feels to you.<br /><br />Now, what's interesting is that for the most part, these are inputs. We are stuck obeying the physical laws of the universe, that's why we call them physical laws. At best motivations are fuzzy guesses for us; we still have no compelling proof that any of us are psychic more than half the time. And no matter what my body and mind tell my heart, it still seems bound and determined to feel what it's going to feel regardless of whether it makes any sense.<br /><br />We do have the ability to create in an admittedly limited fashion. We can use our grasp of physics to do cool things like go to work or the moon. We can learn and communicate and design pretty cool things that can carry us to work or the moon. And we can learn to cope and grieve and recover.<br /><br />So this is all well and good, but so far it's just the kind of thing only dead greeks would love. Why am I even bothering to post this? I'm so glad I asked.<br /><br />There are two things that I've been kicking around as corollaries to this idea. The first is about balance. The second is about spirit.<br /><br />I went to the hospital a few months ago, and one of the contributing factors, at least in my opinion, to why I didn't realize just how sick I'd become is just how stressed I was in the weeks leading up to the ER. In hindsight, it wasn't any more stress than I'd felt at other points in my life, but in this particular case it nearly killed me.<br /><br />I'm starting to think that for each of these three inputs there are activities and people in your life that stimulate and those that sedate. I think it's critical to try to balance these.<br /><br />For instance, my job tends to be highly mentally stimulating. For me, television, radio, and books are also mentally stimulating, though for many of my friends one or all of these are mentally sedating. Drinking is also mentally stimulating. For whatever reason, games and puzzles are very sedating to me. I feel mentally relaxed and refreshed afterwards; exercising my brain this way is play time for me.<br /><br />I have had very physically demanding jobs in the past, and thankfully at the same time I had a church family that was very into hugging. When Bonfire fell, I'm not sure if I've ever been so devastated. But the bonfire guys, the dorms, and the university came together in powerful and powerfully supportive ways.<br /><br />Looking back over my life, I find that the more I do the things that are mentally, physically and emotionally demanding, the more I need the things that are equally relaxing. And I find that the more I am forced into times of long mental, physical, or emotional ennui, the more intently I chase the corresponding stimuli.<br /><br />This is all coming to mind because lately I feel overstimulated emotionally, and I realize now that I have long neglected my emotional rest.<br /><br />There is a certain appeal to asceticism. I've always been of the opinion that ascetics pursue the lack of everything. If there is something they can do without, then they do without it. But from the perspective of this post, they aren't doing without, they're simply trying to narrow the bounds of what could stimulate and sedate them, so it's much easier to achieve balance.<br /><br />In a very real sense, I've been an emotional ascetic for quite some time. I have bounded what makes me feel into such a narrow range, I can give off the perception of being passionate without really having to feel anything at all.<br /><br />This isn't healthy. I know lots of things that physically and mentally stimulate and sedate me. I'm generally interested in finding more. But I have somehow classified emotional stimulation as drama, and drama as bad. On it's own, that may not be a bad thing, but it means that I haven't spent much time looking for emotional sedation, and so I am wholly unprepared for the drama that can't be escaped simply by ignoring the phone and staying off Facebook.<br /><br />Which leads to the next corollary to the theory that being made in God's image means I am triune man. It turns out that what keeps creation consistent is the creator. I'm invited to participate in creation, but it's subject to his will, not mine. And what we find is that God, in his infinite-ness, does not have a short-term view of the world. For him, cancer and car wrecks are not the end. His plan is about eternity, not whether you'll ace your final exam.<br /><br />As it turns out, mind, body, and heart are simply not enough to create in a way that's consistent with all the other minds, bodies, and hearts out there - especially not in any way consistent with God the Father (mind), the Son (body) and the Holy Spirit (heart). Snuck that in on you; I realized I hadn't actually bridged back to the whole "image" thing, so there you go.<br /><br />He gave us his Spirit. That's the whole point of baptism, so that we would have a physical, tangible reminder of being born of the wind, the water, and the word. And he gave us his spirit, "poured out" on us in fact, that we might pour it out on each other. We have been given the very essence of the creator; it has changed the very essence of us that we might continue to change the very essence of each other. This is powerful and miraculous and beautiful and... mine.<br /><br />I do think that there is something very real that happens in love above and beyond the other 3 parts. The mind, body, and heart all respond and react to love, but I believe that there is something deep and lasting and permanent when someone gives their spirit to someone else. My mom will always be a part of me even though she's been dead for over a decade. My friends who died at Bonfire are still here in a very real way, because I am still here. The people with whom I have shared love in years past but whose paths have not crossed mine in what feels like forever... you don't have to look hard to see their fingerprints all over me.<br /><br />This isn't just filling up someone's bucket or silly stuff like that. This is something real. I have something to give you. I want you to have it. It's not mine in the sense that I own it. It's mine because it was given to me to give to you. And I want you to have it because the person who gave it to me said he'd be with me always. And when I give it to you, he'll be with you always as well. Will I be with you too? I don't know for sure, but I think so. Given the people who have always been with me - yeah, I'm pretty convinced. Not in the way he's with me, granted; but hey, we're only an image.<br /><br />So I am now four things: mind, body, heart, and spirit. I am these four totally distinct yet not separate parts that I might know him, experience his creation and participate in creating with him. This is what it means to be created in his image. This is what it means to be redeemed as his son. This is what it means to be called as his disciple. This is what it means to be in love with the creator of all things, the Lord God Almighty. That's even cooler than going to the moon.
