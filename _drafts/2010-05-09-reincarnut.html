Have you ever had a dream where in the dream you dreamt you were dreaming? It's a very disorienting feeling. It turns out that two steps into the rabbit hole have a substantially different effect than just one. <br /><br />Several times now over the past 30-some-odd years I've had the sneaking suspicion that I'm actually living in the rabbit hole. I frequently tell the Old Stories and it feels like they belong to someone else. Even reading old blog posts gives me the uneasy feeling that they were written by a good friend about a mutual acquaintance and not by me, about me. I don't feel like I've lived a long life. I feel like I've lived a whole bunch of short ones.<br /><br />And the connections to those past lives seem tenuous at best. When I run into a former student who talks about what an ass of a professor I was, it's hard to even relate to the man they describe. When I chat with an ex who's found happiness in a new guy, I can't picture the way it felt to be together. I have these fleeting memories, tiny snapshots of sensations, but not enough to put together any sort of pattern. Those past events and relationships feel disconnected, like I'm standing on the outside of a dirty window where the poor lighting and street noise almost completely opaque any view of the inside.<br /><br />Perhaps it is just in my psyche's best interest; a defense mechanism built to move past the loss of both the good and the bad from my past. But I feel like it is something subtly deeper.
