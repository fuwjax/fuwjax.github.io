When I was a kid I remember being very annoyed with the practice of praying before and after meals. In my opinion eating should be no more or less elevated than anything else we do in a day. In protest I started praying before and after everything - passing through a doorway, opening a container, reading a book. It escalated into praying before and after more and more ridiculous things until finally I was meta-praying; thanking God for the prayer I was just about to pray and the one I had just prayed.

It is only a tiny bit ironic then that I now find myself not praying, but being thankful, as frequently as possible. This is my faith, a posture of eternal gratitude to God for the tremendous gift of you, and to you for the tiny gift of whatever little thing you just did. This same posture lends itself to forgiveness as well - what is a little thing you've done to hurt me compared to the pile of little things you've done to bless me and the mountain He has moved to bless me through you?

Here you may find the thank yous that made their way to print.
