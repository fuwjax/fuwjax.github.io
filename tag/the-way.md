C.S. Lewis in [Meditation in a Toolshed](https://www.calvin.edu/~pribeiro/DCM-Lewis-2009/Lewis/meditation-in-a-toolshed.pdf "PDF version") makes the observation that observations tend to be either "looking at" or "looking along" the experience. These posts are largely looking at the concept of faith and my faith in particular. If you're more interested in looking along, you might find something to suit your tastes over in [Offering](tag/offering "looking along my faith").
