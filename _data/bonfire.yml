    i have a feeling this may become quite a long message and i appologize (in advance)  I saw the last Fightin' Texas Aggie Bonfire burn in 1998, it was my first semester in college (Blinn) and i thought bonfire was the most pointless excuse to drink beer i had ever seen. but i went and had a blast.  i had no idea that the next year, that big, pointless, stack of wood would change my life forever. Prior to
    November 18, 1999 i had absolutely NO desire to be an aggie.  i hated this school and everything it stood for.  i thought it was completely overrated, aggies were SOOO incredibly conceited and condecending, and i HATED tradition.  i am, by nature, a nonconformist. i had plans to transfer to a university up north in spring '00; i had an apartment, a job, a roomate up there,everything.  Then it happened. my first concern was that i knew someone on stack. i was so afraid that someone i knew and loved was burried beneath that Godforsaken pile of logs. as the day progressed i stayed glued to the tv, the radio, anything that would tell me what was going on.  as it turns out, i didn't know anyone. i went to the memorial at reed anyway.  i have NEVER felt such a loss.  i felt as if 12 of my closest friends had been killed. i don't know why, but for some reason the Aggie Spirit came alive in me that night.  every day of my life following November 18, 1999 i have lived as a proud Fightin' Texas Aggie. i cancled all my plans for school up north, applied to A&M and here i am.  And let me assure you, i bleed maroon and white.  thanks for listening to my ramblings.

    \[Fuwjax],
    God Bless Bonfire and the Aggie Spirit. 
    Bonfire '99 was my first bonfire, I lost 12 brothers and sisters that day.  When i tell the story to non-Ags I always add that it was good to be an Aggie those days after the fall.  We desprately clung together, like we did at cut or stack, because we were united by Bonfire.  Bonfire was one of the greatest things about Texas A&M, I have never seen it burn in person, though I would like to.  I would build it 100 times over, just to be out there with my brothers and sisters again.  [Fuwjax], thank you for being my brother and thank you for shedding light on to the ashes of Bonfire for our younger brothers and sister.
    Thanks and

    Hey \[Fuwjax],
    You are an inspiration to many... Dont listen to the whiners in class.  They are too shallow to take to heart.  Listen to your mind and your heart, they will be with you the longest. Love life, and enjoy the rest.  Peace.

    It hurts me now to see the lack of Unity within the structure of the dorms now days.  I, for my first two years here, enjoyed the friendships I made, ones not possible without the kinship brought about by Bonfire.  [Fuwjax], you are truely an amazing person, with an amazing mind.  Thanks for your thoughts on Bonfire.  If you want to read a poem I wrote about [The Collapse of 99](http://www.ctp2nd.com/server.php?file=bonfire), click that link.  It was written the day of her fall.
    Thanks and
    Gig'em,

    Okay, I jsut read your simple thougts page...I never thought you of all people could make me cry like that.  The only tears I''ve shed because of you were over that lovely 29 I made of your first test.  I just want to say that what you wrote was beautiful.  I wish I could have known more about it.

    I just read your thoughts on Bonfire. I must say those were the most poignant words I''ve heard about bonfire. As a freshman, I''m sorry I will miss it the next two years and I will cherish any kind of bonfire if it has the feeling you so personally described. And God bless your friends you unfortunately lost.

    Thanks \[Fuwjax]...for sharing what Bonfire is all about.  I regret missing out on all those feelings...but it will always live on through people like you who understand.  Thanks for making me realize it''s more than a two-sided issue, you changed my
    perpective.

    Your "Simple Thoughts" have been the best thing that I''ve ever read concerning Bonfire.  It was gorgeous and so incredibly honest, that is becomes captivating...so much so that you cant hold back the tears, so you just cry.  And I did.  And I love you too.

    I just read your "simple thoughts" page, and I am typing through my tears right now. I just wanted to share with you that although, we, as freshman will not experience Bonfire the way that you did, you touched at least one of us with the beauty of it through your "ramblings". Thank you, and I am so sorry about your friends. I have no doubt that they were amazing people,

    I was just number four to read your 'Simple Thoughts'.  I am a transfer student this year from Arizona and have heard a lot about bonfire, I was not sure what to think about it, good or bad..  You shed a different light on the subject.  I am still not sure what to think about it but I understand and appreciate your passion for it.  I seem to remember a country girl once giving a similar speech.  You should have
    been a farmer or rancher, the same disciplines apply!

    I just was one of the three people that you said would read you're "excerpt" about the bonfire. I dont know much about it but i just wanted to tell you that that was really cool and I think that should be on the main webpage so everyone can see it.

    I just wanted to let you know how what you said about Bonfire made me cry.  although i have never worked on Bonfire and it looks like never will be able to, I have seen others sweat and hurt together to build Bonfire.  I truly wish that i along with class of '04 could join you in your pride and pain of Bonfire.  What you said on that
    page  made me cry not because of sadness or pain due to the fact that it will never be that way again.  But because what you said on that page is exactly what i have tried to say to those who ask me what i think about Bonfire.  I didn't feel right not telling you that.

    I just had my husband read your incredible and passionate thoughts on bonfire.  He is
    a graduate of A&M and worked on bonfire for five years.  I remember when the bonfire tragedy happened and the way he cried.  I remember how strong the need for him was to visit the bonfire site and pay his respect to the kids that were lost.  I just watched him get tears in his eyes as he read your thoughts on bonfire.  You and he and all the others that were privileged enough to work on bonfire understand.  I regret that many of us Ags will never know what you two know, the love of one Ag for another.  This love still lives strong in my husband and he worked on bonfire in the '70's.  That is what bonfire is, it is forever.

    i read your Simple thoughts on Bonfire and was moved so deeply. I passed it along to some friends and family of mine, and my oldest sister, (Class '95), e-mailed me back almost immediately saying that she was sitting at her desk at work crying. I would like to share one exerpt of her e-mail with you tho...
    "I hate that you won't be able to experience your bonfire your freshman year.  I understand that those who don't understand want 'something done' so the same tragedy doesn't reoccur.  But, you're teacher said it all when he said, "You see, Bonfire taught us, in the craziest possible way, to love."  It's when we see people as people, not as a blonde or brunette, not as a boy or a girl, not as a jock or a geek, but as a human being, that we see Christ in each and every person."
    I found this one to be the most touching paragraph of her long e-mail. Thank you for sharing your opinion...and i do think that that is the same opinion that a lot of people share. I am certain that my sister agrees with you...she wrote:
    I know you think I'm a big softy, but when you feel so strongly about something and someone else can write the words you're feeling...well, it brings tears to my
    eyes.  And always will!
    Thanks again...
