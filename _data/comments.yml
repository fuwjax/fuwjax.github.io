    It hurts me now to see the lack of Unity within the structure of the dorms now days.  I, for my first two years here, enjoyed the friendships I made, ones not possible without the kinship brought about by Bonfire.  [Fuwjax], you are truely an amazing person, with an amazing mind.  Thanks for your thoughts on Bonfire.  If you want to read a poem I wrote about [The Collapse of 99](http://www.ctp2nd.com/server.php?file=bonfire), click that link.  It was written the day of her fall.
    Thanks and
    Gig'em,

    Okay, I jsut read your simple thougts page...I never thought you of all people could make me cry like that.  The only tears I''ve shed because of you were over that lovely 29 I made of your first test.  I just want to say that what you wrote was beautiful.  I wish I could have known more about it.

    I just read your thoughts on Bonfire. I must say those were the most poignant words I''ve heard about bonfire. As a freshman, I''m sorry I will miss it the next two years and I will cherish any kind of bonfire if it has the feeling you so personally described. And God bless your friends you unfortunately lost.

    perpective.

    Your "Simple Thoughts" have been the best thing that I''ve ever read concerning Bonfire.  It was gorgeous and so incredibly honest, that is becomes captivating...so much so that you cant hold back the tears, so you just cry.  And I did.  And I love you too.

    I just read your "simple thoughts" page, and I am typing through my tears right now. I just wanted to share with you that although, we, as freshman will not experience Bonfire the way that you did, you touched at least one of us with the beauty of it through your "ramblings". Thank you, and I am so sorry about your friends. I have no doubt that they were amazing people,

    I was just number four to read your 'Simple Thoughts'.  I am a transfer student this year from Arizona and have heard a lot about bonfire, I was not sure what to think about it, good or bad..  You shed a different light on the subject.  I am still not sure what to think about it but I understand and appreciate your passion for it.  I seem to remember a country girl once giving a similar speech.  You should have
    been a farmer or rancher, the same disciplines apply!

    I just wanted to let you know how what you said about Bonfire made me cry.  although i have never worked on Bonfire and it looks like never will be able to, I have seen others sweat and hurt together to build Bonfire.  I truly wish that i along with class of '04 could join you in your pride and pain of Bonfire.  What you said on that
    page  made me cry not because of sadness or pain due to the fact that it will never be that way again.  But because what you said on that page is exactly what i have tried to say to those who ask me what i think about Bonfire.  I didn't feel right not telling you that.

    I just had my husband read your incredible and passionate thoughts on bonfire.  He is
    a graduate of A&M and worked on bonfire for five years.  I remember when the bonfire tragedy happened and the way he cried.  I remember how strong the need for him was to visit the bonfire site and pay his respect to the kids that were lost.  I just watched him get tears in his eyes as he read your thoughts on bonfire.  You and he and all the others that were privileged enough to work on bonfire understand.  I regret that many of us Ags will never know what you two know, the love of one Ag for another.  This love still lives strong in my husband and he worked on bonfire in the '70's.  That is what bonfire is, it is forever.

    i read your Simple thoughts on Bonfire and was moved so deeply. I passed it along to some friends and family of mine, and my oldest sister, (Class '95), e-mailed me back almost immediately saying that she was sitting at her desk at work crying. I would like to share one exerpt of her e-mail with you tho...
    "I hate that you won't be able to experience your bonfire your freshman year.  I understand that those who don't understand want 'something done' so the same tragedy doesn't reoccur.  But, you're teacher said it all when he said, "You see, Bonfire taught us, in the craziest possible way, to love."  It's when we see people as people, not as a blonde or brunette, not as a boy or a girl, not as a jock or a geek, but as a human being, that we see Christ in each and every person."
    I found this one to be the most touching paragraph of her long e-mail. Thank you for sharing your opinion...and i do think that that is the same opinion that a lot of people share. I am certain that my sister agrees with you...she wrote:
    I know you think I'm a big softy, but when you feel so strongly about something and someone else can write the words you're feeling...well, it brings tears to my
    eyes.  And always will!
    Thanks again...

    God Bless Bonfire and the Aggie Spirit. 
    Bonfire '99 was my first bonfire, I lost 12 brothers and sisters that day.  When i tell the story to non-Ags I always add that it was good to be an Aggie those days after the fall.  We desprately clung together, like we did at cut or stack, because we were united by Bonfire.  Bonfire was one of the greatest things about Texas A&M, I have never seen it burn in person, though I would like to.  I would build it 100 times over, just to be out there with my brothers and sisters again.  [Fuwjax], thank you for being my brother and thank you for shedding light on to the ashes of Bonfire for our younger brothers and sister.
    Thanks and

    i have a feeling this may become quite a long message and i appologize (in advance)  I saw the last Fightin' Texas Aggie Bonfire burn in 1998, it was my first semester in college (Blinn) and i thought bonfire was the most pointless excuse to drink beer i had ever seen. but i went and had a blast.  i had no idea that the next year, that big, pointless, stack of wood would change my life forever. Prior to
    November 18, 1999 i had absolutely NO desire to be an aggie.  i hated this school and everything it stood for.  i thought it was completely overrated, aggies were SOOO incredibly conceited and condecending, and i HATED tradition.  i am, by nature, a nonconformist. i had plans to transfer to a university up north in spring '00; i had an apartment, a job, a roomate up there,everything.  Then it happened. my first concern was that i knew someone on stack. i was so afraid that someone i knew and loved was burried beneath that Godforsaken pile of logs. as the day progressed i stayed glued to the tv, the radio, anything that would tell me what was going on.  as it turns out, i didn't know anyone. i went to the memorial at reed anyway.  i have NEVER felt such a loss.  i felt as if 12 of my closest friends had been killed. i don't know why, but for some reason the Aggie Spirit came alive in me that night.  every day of my life following November 18, 1999 i have lived as a proud Fightin' Texas Aggie. i cancled all my plans for school up north, applied to A&M and here i am.  And let me assure you, i bleed maroon and white.  thanks for listening to my ramblings.

    I actually think the analogy works better as the welcome mat.  Once you're inside, you know you're welcome, you don't need to have the reminder anymore.  The birth certificate is always there and all it says is you're alive after this date.  There's no love, just a fact.

    reading that just took me back to your classroom.  Sitting on the front row, in heldenfelds (or how ever the hell that name was spelled).  It was your class, more likely the large amount of hours in your office that made me for the first time appriciate math.  i struggled through and barley passed, yet that was the one class i didn't mind going to.  dang that was 4 years ago, i hadn't thought about that since.  Actually it was time in your office that inspired this blog name.  Talking about Tonka trucks (with personalized licence plates) and shrinky dinks.  well this has all been very random.

    I can't rember where, but recently I heard a 'soul brother' sounding narrator reading: "...words like stones CAN break bones..." and I about threw up.  
    Which reinterprets my recollection somewhat:
    "Staffs and stones may break my bones, but information can only make me nauseous."
    Since the ancient days of Egypt are long past, snakes and staffs no longer seem interchangeable; they weren't terribly interchangeable even then.  Today, snakes and information seem more interchangeable, on a semantic level at least.
    Which brings me to my main comment: This title is disturbing, when placed in context with the content of your blog.  Come to think of it, so was the title of your previous blog.  I am curious to know if this was intentional.  Can a man know what is most disturbing about himself?  If he intended to be disturbing, then the intent to be disturbing would be more so, I submit.

    It is that desire to learn... that firm belief that no obstacle is insurmountable... that tiny flame that burns somewhere deep in our minds, in our hearts and in our souls that longs to consume the unknown in a fitful, frightful pursuit of knowledge and understanding...  it is that motivation that I hope to have instilled and distilled in my students.  I am proud of all of my students' successes, a word which I will somewhat arbitrarily define as "that state in which you now find yourself."  And I hope success chases you while you chase the truth.

    Was our anti-relationship really so anti-short?  It didn't seem that long, though that is much to be expected as anti-time does fly.
    It is truly a shame that the only things really real about our anti-relationship were the eggs that came between us and the pain that filled the void the eggs left behind.
    Ah, and the story... always the story.

    A birth certificate proves who I am, and whose I am.  It is nothing but love, a love so deep and rich that I have been claimed and named.
    A birth certificate is very much a welcome mat, but where a welcome mat just says "Welcome to my home; wipe your feet, would you?" a birth certificate says "Welcome to the family that's been waiting for you."

    Disturbing?  no, of course not... Offensive?  definitely.  (who wasn't expecting a symantic debate?)
    And is it more offensive that I was trying to be offensive?  Oh I most certainly hope so.
    It is the impact, or at least the impulse which breaks bones... and information has had far more of an impact than any stick, excepting perhaps a particular one on a particular hill, and it has required more impulse than any snake, excepting perhaps a particular one in a particular garden.
    As for stones... You know what they say... You can't keep a good man down...  Especially a really good man... Even with a really really big stone.  Really.

    I'd say the blue jeans, black boots, belt and t-shirt, long hair, and a chain coming out of your pocket had less to do with your being percieved as a social deviant than the fact that you're a social deviant.  At least this is what the lovely people behind us at dinner would have assumed after listening to your "101 uses for the vertically challenged".

    Look, is it really my fault that I'm of the opinion that the little people are just more inherently useful than the rest of us?  In fact, if it were possible, I think we should genetically alter all babies to be midgets.
    Just think of it... 
    You're at a baseball game and everyone in the row in front of you stands up, but you don't have to; you can see over them just fine.  
    Or you're crowd surfing at a concert and you're dropped to the ground, but you only fall about 3 feet.  
    You're cleaning out your closet, and you decide it's finally time to throw away that jacket you've had since 4th grade.
    Imagine the impact on our economy and ecology.  We could build our houses half as high, skyscrapers could have twice as many floors.  We could have much smaller cars, which would dramatically reduce the effects of rush hour.
    Let's face it people, midgets aren't freaks or mistakes, they're the future.  We're witnessing human evolution here people.

    Sorry to inject a bit of reality (ouch - the stuff stings) into the conversation, but isn't Fuwjax one of the FEW people who looked the way he does because he is NOT trying to conform?  Weekend road warriors don't rebel, they switch.  
    And height is not a woman-related quality.  I'd wear stilts or cut my feet off if I thought it would get me a date.  No, I'm just looking for a woman who is not scared of me.  I mean, come on!  The dark hordes of demons that hound me aren't MY fault!

    As the aforementioned "L" or "Lindsay", I would like to point out that, while all the above points about the usefulness of small people are valid, it still does not make them any more realistic.  There are not many of us out there for a reason; God knew the world could only handle so much wit, brains, beauty, (insert any other positive quality).  All of these qualities are clearly evident in high volumes within every small person.  Therefore, dreaming of a world where so many exist is a mute topic because God knows what's best, He's leaving some room for the taller folk to get some recognition.  So appreciate what you have and I'll enjoy my oversized portion of blessings :)

    I would like to meet your wife. Know why? Because she will be, hands down, the most selfless and least selfish woman I have ever met. 
    I know this because, as I told my own husband just yesterday (yes, yesterday!), despite how wonderful you are, I could never have married you. I'm too selfish. You see...you love too many people and, even more importantly, too many people love you. It would be like being a minister's wife. No, it WOULD be being a minister's wife. :)
    Therefore, I would like to meet your wife. You just keep that in mind. :) 
    We LOVE you and we MISS you!!

    I won't pretend to know anything about my wife, but I wouldn't think she'll be the most selfless woman on the planet.  Seems to me, she'd have to be pretty selfish and arrogant to think she's special enough to marry me.  Frankly she sounds like she might not be a very nice woman at all.  Maybe I don't want to meet her... :)
    I found this in the diary I mention in the next post, I found it a bit funny that I've felt this way for so long.
    <EM>I have known some of the most beautiful women on the planet.  It blows my mind that they even bother to talk to me.  It is beyond belief that some of them like me.  It breaks the scale of feasibility that they consider me a friend.  It is simply impossible for any to love me, yet they do.  And I am astounded by the fact that my attraction to them is bounded by "good friend" and nothing more.</EM>

    I did have a ruckus or two in just about all of my classes, but there was only one fruit cocktail riot, so if it sounds familiar, you were probably there.
    It's sort of a shame that it's been so long since I've told these stories.  I can't remember exactly word for word what was said any more.  I do remember the comments leading up to the riot were some of the funniest comments I've ever heard uttered, but other than that, all I can remember is the gist.  All the joys of old age.
    I have a few more class stories that I ought to get posted soon, assuming I can remember enough about them to post them.

    Perhaps we should declare today : awareness day, and everyone can sing my "Ode to My Ass" from a previous post.  Bob

    I recently heard a sermon on the "Going" part of our faith life.  The great commission, as Mathew 28 is called, is something that I, and I am sure almost every other Christian, see as something for the another Christian, blessed more by God with the spiritual gift of evagelism, to do.  I also know that I, and would only assume that many other Christians do as well, come to turning points in our faith when we ask the question:  is this it? I beleive in Jesus, poof! my sin is gone? 
    This is a two-fold problem.  One is that yes, that's it. The difference between Christianity and other world religions is Grace (with a capitol G because it's from God).  Other world religions are inward, human focused.  I have all these rules to aspire to...I will live my life this way to be more powerful and more "good" in the next life....I will purge my life of 'stuff' to focus on how I relate to the world and reach an utopia.      By default, human nature says The Only Way can't be the  one that has nothing to do with WHAT we do.  That would be too simple, but in steps Christ to save us all, give us Grace, and make it just that 'simple'
    The second problem in an answer to "is this it?" Comes in knowing rather or not we are living a Faith life that is full and complete, because, no, this is not it.  
    How do we know?  Let's look at 1 John 1: 2-4 to see:
    "The life appeared; we have seen it and testify to it, and we proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and has appeared to us.  3We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you also may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ.   
    We see from these verses that 1. belief, Faith if you will, is necessary.  Next, 2. telling others so that 3.  they can join in the fellowship of believers.  
    This is why we should evangelize, right?  For the good of others, right?  Is this it? 
    No!
    Verse 4:  
    "We write this to make our joy complete." 
    Happiness is an emotion. Human.  Joy comes from God.  If Grace is getting the cookie anyway after you were punished for hitting your brother.  Joy is knowing that the cookies will never run out.  There will always be a fresh batch right out of the oven.  
    The 'going' part of our Faith is looked at as "aw, man i have to."  When, instead, it should be "Whoop!  I get to!"  Because not only are you doing the will of God by  following the last words Christ said to his followers, but you are also doing something for yourself.  God says that He would rejoice(to be filled with joy) more over one turned sinner, then over a room full of believers.  When you do the 'going' part you experience that Joy and understand the heart of God a little bit more.

    Hahahaha. I just had to sit and laugh at this one. I too was part of the great Mike's math class. It was my first semester of my freshman year and I remember being scared to death on the first day!! (Although it ended up being one of the best classes!) I was in their the semester after the infamous "goat" evaluation, which made for quite a few funny jokes. I also ended up in your office almost every week for help. I even came back a few semester later when I was taking "math for elementary school teachers" to get some more help! My roommate and I still laugh at the grand times in Mike's class!

    Hey, bud!  Good thoughts.  This post reminds me of something I read recently from St. John of the Cross, so I thought I'd share: "The soul remembers the words of the Bridegroom in the Gospel, 'No man can serve two masters,' and therefore in order not to lose God, he loses all that is not God.  He who truly loves makes shipwreck of himself in all else, that he may more easily gain the object of his love."
    Betsy just pointed me to your blog, so I'm catching up on it :-)  BTW, if you want to see some ridiculous and not very funny comics I've been making on my lunch break at work, check out www.monkeybarcongressman.net.  Maybe in the future they will be funnier, but no promises.  Today I am rewriting the dialogue to an Archie comic -- that may show up there soon, when I get the comic scanned in and change all the voice bubbles :)

    The term for rapid jumps in evolution is "punctuated equilibrium" (or "punk eek," for short :)  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuated_equilibrium)
    The book "Darwin's Black Box" by Michael Behe presents a biological argument against the Theory of Evolution called the principle of irreducible complexity -- it's worth checking out.  Behe's a molecular biologist, and he looks at several very small biological systems (for example, the system that allows your blood to clot) and shows how these systems (1) could not function if any part of them were taken away, and (2) are too complex to have developed all at once (even within a time of punctuated equilibrium).
    Many Evolutionists believe that Creationism is taken on faith while Evolution is based on science.  However, there is currently no explanation for this problem of irreducible complexity -- Evolutionists simply say, "we hope to one day understand how that happened."  In the face of evidence that points to a Creator, they continue to take Evolution on the basis of faith.  It's important to know this, because in a discussion about our origins it levels the playing field -- elements of faith are required to believe Creationism and Evolution.  Knowing this makes it harder to dismiss Creationists as nuts who ignore science.
    Your last paragraph especially was awesome, Mike.  Thanks :)

    Obviously, not repenting enough is bad.  This leads me to ask:  do you think someone can repent too much?
    While we're speaking of repentance, Derek Webb talks about his song "I Repent" on his CD "The House Show".  To sum up his intro to the song, he says: 
    "We often believe that the Christian life is about how well we can learn to hide our sin.  A lot of us think we can measure the growth of our spiritually by how little we are sinning, or at least by trying to convince ourselves and others that we are not sinning.  But the Christian life is not about hiding our sins or living in fear that they might be exposed.  Take joy in the fact that your sins are real and that your Savior is real."  
    At first I thought it weird to relate joy with recognizing sin, but in light of the relationship between repentance and forgiveness, I think it makes sense.  Naturally, being a student of Rev. K's and a reader of Romans, I have to add "what shall we say then?  shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase?"  me ginomai!  "By no means!  We died to sin.  How can we live in it any longer?"
    --------------------------------
    "I Repent" by Derek Webb
    --------------------------------
    I repent of my pursuit of America's dream 
    I repent of living like I deserve anything 
    my house, my fence, my kids, and my wife 
    In our suburb where we're safe and white 
    I am wrong and of these things I repent 
    I repent of parading my liberty 
    I repent of paying for what I get for free 
    the way I believe that I am living right 
    by trading sins for others that are easier to hide 
    I am wrong and of these things I repent 
    I repent judging by a law that even I can't keep 
    wearing righteousness like a disguise to see through 
    the planks in my own eyes 
    I repent of trading truth for false unity 
    I repent of confusing peace and idolatry 
    of caring more of what they think than what I know of what they need 
    and domesticating You until You look just like me 
    I am wrong and of these things I repent

    Good to have you back on the blogosphere, man!  Congrats on the new neice :)
    According to <A HREF="http://www.blogger.com/r?http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lcms.org%2Fpages%2Finternal.asp%3FNavID%3D4411">this</A>, "Polycarp (69-155 AD), a disciple of the Apostle John, was baptized as an infant."  So it looks like it was a very early practice of the church, which is also a good sign that we should be practicing it in the same way.

    Hi!!!!! We missed you!!!! Congratulations!! I cannot think of a better Godparent in the WORLD than YOU! 
    So, I think what you said was very nice. It confused me, though. I don't buy the circumcision or household argurments for various reasons, but those don't matter since you didn't talk about it anyway. And I don't particularly care about whether people dedicate or baptize, as long as they're bringing their children up in the Lord, which I know my friends (the ones who prompted the question) will do. 
    But their relatives, the ones who say "you'd better baptize the baby b/c if you don't and he dies, he's going to hell" - they concern me; I think that's silliness. So I'm curious and want clarification from someone I consider rational and with a strong biblical understanding. What is the eternal condition of a baby who dies post-birth, pre-baptism? What is the eternal condition of an adult, who was baptized as an infant, yet hates the Lord and worships the devil, or himself? 
    I guess my thing is that the Bible says a bunch of times "repent and be baptized", "believe and be batpized", etc. 
    Ok! We LOVE you and we MISS you and we hope everything  is BEAUTIFUL where you are!
    Love! (Seth and) Steph

    Hey Steph,
    Good questions!  Hopefully some of my comments will help.  I don't think I'm as biblically knowledgable as my brother, but I have a few views on what you asked.
    <B>What is the eternal condition of a baby who dies post-birth, pre-baptism?</B>
    I can't answer this one except with, God knows the heart of the child.  Even if it's alive a few minutes, days, months, or even if it's miscarried or aborted.  I've always wondered about this, but as I'm not God, I'm not sure what he does about these circumstances.
    <B>But their relatives, the ones who say "you'd better baptize the baby b/c if you don't and he dies, he's going to hell"</B>
    Yeah, I don't like this at all either.  We know that being baptized doesn't guarantee that you're going to Heaven.  Jesus said to the thief on the cross, "Today you will be with me in paradise." I'm pretty sure he wasn't baptized.  Once again, God knows the heart of every person and that is the deciding factor as to whether you're going to Heaven or not.
    <B>What is the eternal condition of an adult, who was baptized as an infant, yet hates the Lord and worships the devil, or himself?</B>
    This question is kind of similar to the ones above.  God gave us free will, so we have the choice to believe in Him, or something else.  So, even if someone were baptized at an early age, jet rejects Him at a later time in their life, I think they'd go to Hell.  Once again, God knows their heart, and that's all that counts.
    Well, hope that helps.
    Mark

    There's a good book by Thomas Lynch called "The Undertaking."  Lynch was a poet and also part owner of a mortuary.  He said when people found out what he did for a living, they'd often say things like, "Well, when I go, I don't need anything special.  Just stick me in a box and dump some dirt on top."  And he'd say back, "Well, that's pretty much what we do with everyone."  His point being that it's hard to die humbly on purpose -- everyone is humbled in death, there's no avoiding it.
    Anyway, your post got me thinking about cremation.  From what I've heard, cremation was pretty much unheard of for Christians until the last century or so.  Until recently, people who had themselves cremated often did so as a way to utterly renounce Christ and the resurrection.  Of course, plenty of Christians are cremated now, and I believe they will somehow be raised with the rest.
    In "The Undertaking," the refrain is "the dead don't care."  Once you're dead, you won't really care if people scatter your ashes or feed your body to sea turtles.  So in making funeral plans for yourself, I think your foremost thought should be: how can I help these people who are grieving?
    Maybe scattering ashes is more helpful, or maybe bearing a coffin to a grave and watching it lower would help them say goodbye.  As for having a gravestone, on the one hand, it's very powerful for me to see gravestones in Oklahoma and Kansas and know that my ancestors are buried there; on the other hand, a gravestone might just be something you'd hit your head on when coming up at the resurrection!
    Made it to level 9 on notpr0n.  Looking forward to getting past level 40 so I can read the rest of your post about it :-)
    Peace,
    Derek

    I would like to have a gravestone, buried or not. Have decided recently that it is sort of like having a special place you pray ("go into your closet, close the door, etc...") and (psychologically speaking) kind of like using your bed only for sleep or your desk only for studying as a way of protecting that space against contamination of unwanted things (e.g., insomnia). Would love to be remembered when my daughter is at the ballet with her daughters, or upon the clatter of dominoes, or in the perfect heat of summer that everyone else dreads, or in any other sort of every-day, active way. But would also like, on occasion, things to be all about me, unspoiled - a place where I can be remembered without any distraction. So there you have it, it's pure selfishness and narcissism to want a gravestone. I admit it, and want one. And, though I would sacrifice my all-important needs to you if you did not want one, I would personally like you to have one. Would I remember you at Yesterdays? Anywhere there's Shiner? The role-playing world? The moments that something long-archaic from the Bible becomes strikingly obvious? Absolutely. That's when I remember you now. But when you die, I would like to go and just think about you. In April, when the bluebonnets are around. And not have my remebrance interuptted by some drunk jackass hitting on me, or some other drunk jackass stabbing whatever winged, bikini-armor-clad character I have at the time. :) Love you. Am entirely too honest and emotional after midnight. Steph

    Then Jesus said, "Come to me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you. Let me teach you, because I am humble and gentle, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke fits perfectly, and the burden I give you is light." - Matthew 11:28-30
    I know that you are a very religious person, but sometimes the heavier the burden we carry the harder it is to go to Christ. There is no way to go back and ask for forgiveness from those who have already died, but you are forgiven in the greatest way imaginable. Where I value the frailty of life, and understand the need to break down and cry, I hope you truly understand that Bonfire falling was in God's hands and not in your own. Bonfire means a lot to me in it's own ways but what amazes me most is all of the good that has come from the devastation and loss of those 12. It's okay to stop and breathe when you need to. In fact, I highly recommend it- just don't over do it. No need to hyperventilate.

    God, You give us such sweet gifts and promises. You gave Your very own Son that we might not have to have hearts twisted or tainted by guilt. You promise that if we will come to You, and let You, You have grace, rest, and peace for us in abundance, and are more than willing to give it. God, take up my brother in Your hands and hold Him close to Your heart, that he may find and hold Your promises, and that they would seem real and honest and fulfilling to him. Thank You for loving us with such a pure, deep, rich love. For being available to us at every moment. Thank You for my brother, who I love, and thank You for loving him infinitely more than any of us whose hearts are hurting for him now. Meet His needs, Lord, in Your perfect way and time.

    My wonderful anonymous friends, thank you so much for your prayers and encouragement.  I apologize if my post made it sound as though I were fishing for such things.  My intention was not to say these things I need are things I don't have, but that instead, just as friend #2 said, I have everything I need in overabundance.  I was trying, apparently unsuccessfully, to tell all of you, my wonderful compassionate caring anonymous friends, to not worry about what I need.  What I need isn't of this world.  Yes I'm broken, yes I hurt, but I have everything.
    I do hope though that everyone understands that just because the events of our lives are a part of God's plan, we are not exempted from being responsible for our actions.  Judas betrayed Christ according to God's plan, but it was still his choice, his action, his guilt.  Make no mistake, forgiveness was offered to Judas as surely as it is offered to me.  While Judas chose to walk away from that forgiveness, I hold on to it with all that I am.
    But we don't live in a vacuum.  The effect of my actions didn't end 6 years ago.  Those actions continue to affect the lives of people I still meet.  And this time when I saw a sliver of the hurt I caused, I broke.
    Make no mistake, these effects will glorify our King, and will become a beautiful part of my relationship with these people.  But the ugliness of sin doesn't go away just because I've gotten over it or moved on or rationalized it or any of the other nonsense phrases I've heard in the last 6 years.  It goes away because Christ is so much more beautiful than my sin.  The ugliness can't stand up to his blood.

    You may not have ever felt able to express truth in poetry well, but man. You certainly have prose down.
    "So while we ride the train of thought through the switchyard of my mind, we must simply hope we will find a way to stay our course through the blur of memories and images which will undoubtedly try to derail us. What follows are the streams and rivers and torrents of my mind, captured in this far too limited way, in the hope that I might honor my mother’s life and the God who so graciously gave it to her."
    Beautiful, Mike. The whole entry. Beautiful thoughts; beautiful delivery.
    I actually cried as I read this post. I am not a crier; I was raised to be "tough." But you moved me. You are amazing. Wonderful. I admire you so much. And you have quite a way with words.

    You have some observations here that I've not heard elsewhere, particularly the tactfulness of the word "we."  I've long felt that there is a science to the courting dynamic, and that I have a good feel for much of it.  I believe you've added a few pages to the book.
    I also appreciated the girlfriend anecdotes in the first couple of paragraphs.  We all have our crazy relationship stories, and I hope you treat them with the same humor I find in mine.

    Seriously, I am so glad you didn't say 8 years.  I used to secretly steal your mayo.
    The secret was originally "No relationship that started with a quiet candle-lit dinner in the Antarctic has ever failed."  But I was afraid people might take me seriously before I had a chance to set up a dating service that catered specifically to Antarctia first dates.

    I can't believe you forgot to mention the girl you never dated and  who broke up with you : )  Thaaaaaaaanks.  Sadly, that was my longest and most healthy relationship to date.  Good times.

    And it seems you forgot that we anti-dated, and anti-broke up, and I already devoted an entire posting to our anti-relationship.
    While it wasn't my longest, it certainly was my most healthy relationship, and at least I know why you anti-left me.  In hindsight it's somewhat surprising that "Never touch a woman's face with raw egg on your hands" has never made it on any of my list of dating rules.

    Can the dynamics of male-male and female-female relationships be of any use in this conversation? And I don't mean romantic ones. But there certainly is intimacy in some non-romantic, same-gender relationships, and it probably is more  akin to the desire for attn than the desire for sex. I don't know if that should even come into the discussion, but I do think it might say something about distinguishing one kind of intimacy from another. *shrugs*
    Miss you!

    Let me think: "If I were a Buddhist, I would neither tell you nor not tell you."
    And: "If I desire something, that is wrong, and if I desire to not desire something, that is wrong.  This implies that I think the word wrong does not mean what I think it means."

    I remember in the fall of 2000 when I came to A&M.  I walked into your class and was instantly greeted by a man, who I believed to be the biggest ass I had ever met.  That feeling only lasted about a week.  At that point you shared these feelings with the class.  I have always had the upmost respect for you since then.  I just found your site again today, I am glad I did.

    Something about your post makes me think of my favorite movie quote from Good Will Hunting:
    Sean to Will: "You're not perfect sport. And let me save you the suspense: this girl you met, she's isn't perfect either, but the question is, whether or not you're perfect for each other. That's the whole deal. That's what intimacy is all about. Now you can know everything in the world sport, but the only way you're finding that one out is by giving it a shot."
    I miss your thought-provoking conversations, Mike!!  Thanks for posting to your blog.  Good luck with everything.

    > if Mary were truly expecting a miracle, why would she think Jesus needed any helpers?
    You might be missing the point.  Mary knew Jesus - and had faith to believe the he could fix the problem.  Did Jesus need help? Well, in the same way, we are entreated to pray continually, and ask for what we need.  Does God need our help to move the kingdom forward with prayer?  No, but he set it up that way, so perhaps Jesus did need Mary's help to have the faith to ask the question.  Although the question is not as much a question as a statement: They have no more wine.

    You wrote this a long time ago, it appears, but I thought I would comment anyway.  I really enjoy discussions with you about dating.  Several years ago, in 2001, I listened to a discussion between you and Thomas about dating, and I wrote about it in my journal.  Dated March 29, 2001, I wrote, "Thomas' thought was that dating is when two people have come to the agreement that they don't see any reason why they could not eventually marry.  Mike saw another perspective.  He sees dating as a glorified lust or a forced affection."  I came away from that conversation realizing that I was completely confused about dating and marriage.  Dating is so prolific nowadays, but I'm not sure if anyone has a clear idea of what it's about.  I know I would much rather pursue friendships than go out on dates with strangers.

    That's really good, man.  Some other gifts Christ gives us: Confession and Absolution, Baptism, and Holy Communion.  If we desire to see God more clearly, we can recognize His presence in bread and wine.  I think that's more important than being in a good small group or having a daily quiet time, good though those things can be.
    And I agree about music -- if it's not about Christ, who am I worshiping?  To flip it around, Christ serves us through the Word and Sacraments, including the Word proclaimed in our music; but what am I receiving from Him when I sing mainly about myself?  I don't need Him to give me a pat on the back and a thumbs up, I need my sins forgiven!
    Thanks for the thoughtful posts, bro.  Hope to see you soon!

    Hey, just happened to check your blog for the first time in a while and thoroughly enjoyed this story.
    But the real question is, what is that company doing about synergizing the monetization of product integration through upward revenue stream dynamics?  Sounds like their CEO really needs to update his corporate management BS vocabulary.

    Super Awesome Wristband update!
    [Company] was in a lawsuit with my new company. It was a totally bogus suit, and it settled out of court. But as part of the deal, my new CEO bought me and my coworkers who formally worked at [Company] immunity from further frivolous lawsuits.
    As a gesture of thanks, I gave my new CEO both of my wristbands.
    In the time since I left [Company], they've had 2 rounds of layoffs, lost a few major projects and shut down the office I worked in. I think that pretty much sums up what they're doing about synergizing the monetization of product integration through upward revenue stream dynamics.

I MISS you. I know I don't act like it, b/c I don't keep in touch the way I should, and I haven't seen you in so long, and for all those other reasons, but it does not diminish my love for you, or how I miss you. Brother, I pray you are well, and blessed.

    Or, it's like this: you have an ex girlfriend. She had no confidence and wasn't very bright when you met her, and you told her she shouldn't better herself, though you let her pick the colors of the drapes. One day she decides to take a class. When you hear about that, you beat the crap out of her and throw her out of your house. And over the years, you make it a point to make her life miserable every once in awhile. Then, one day, your son meets her, and a guy who used to be your best friend tells her to kill him. She doesn't want to, but he badgers him into it, and that's when she finds out that it was all part of your plan all along. You knew that your friend would badger her into it. And now, all she has to do is beg for forgiveness for wanting to go to class, to fall to her knees and say you can do whatever you want to her, and you'll still make her life miserable, but some later time promise that you'll take care of her. 
    That's not love. 
    In the bible, Jesus got rid of the original sin that damned us all to "death" or "hell"... despite it having been significantly more than 7 generations. 
    Oh, pastors say that we're all 'miserable', but y'know what? Some of us are happy, even without any shred of God. But the only way we aren't damned by God, according to you, is if we fall on our knees and say how awful we are and beg, BEG, for forgiveness. 
    No thanks.

    I'm actually the person who originally posed the question.  The blog was linked to me.
    I really like your response to the question, as it makes it nearly impossible to dispute God's grace.  I don't think, however, that God's grace was ever in question.
    It's important to note the key difference between your analogy and Christ's salvation of every convicted soul on Earth (edited to clarify that I am aware the Bible says we aren't all saved).  The difference lies in the pursuit of glory, which is the only thing God cares more about than Jesus or his people.  
    Saving billions of people you've created and saving one person are not the same, and God knew that, or else he would have just saved a select few.  (In fact, there are examples in the Bible such as God's destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah where he did only spare a select few.  A consistency throughout the Bible is that, historically, he has completely eradicated anyone who came in the way of his glory.  In fact, at one point, he asked Abraham to start the entire human race over from the start.)
    When we became sinners, collectively, we jeopardized all the glory that God had created the Earth to seek.  He had no choice but to completely start over.
    The lucky thing for us is that while God was ashamed at the direction we turned our souls, he loved his creation so much, that he sent his perfect son to start the entire thing over, be a martyr, and provide an eternal example of how we were to live our lives.
    God saves individuals because of grace and love, but he saved the entire world in one fell swoop to further the glory of his kingdom.
    The reason your scenario appears to be an insurmountable sacrifice is the level of grace involved, but it ignores the glory God attained by making that sacrifice.
    Another inconsistency, say the ex-girlfriend was the last remaining person on Earth and shunning her would leave zero companions.  This was the situation God was left with.  He could ignore us, or he could forgive us and once again be companions with the billions he lovingly created with the purpose of expanding his empire.
    For myself, the ultimate sacrifice is my own life.  When I have children some day, I have little doubt that my personal ultimate sacrifice will be the lives of my children.
    For the Lord, however, the ultimate sacrifice is his glory, and when it came down to it, that's not what he chose to give up.
    Lastly, my point was not meant to be nearly as blasphemous as you interpreted.  In context, my point is questioning the notion that God made the ultimate sacrifice.  I never implied it wasn't a sacrifice.  It's not a matter of faith as much as it is a theological stance on a commonly used church catch-phrase.  I am eternally grateful for the forgiveness and grace that God has shown me in my life.

    I'm not anonymous - from last November, I think;  I just didn't have this account yet at the time - and had an instant message session with you long before that led to another post.
    james has a Glory insight that has to prove undoing to our desires to see a relationship descend from the sacrifice, to infinite justice, of the maximum-inconceivable mercy.  I can see this much.
    All five of us commenters have something great to learn, now, if the subject is not at its heart a plan of... of atoning sacrificial restoration-slash-arguable-showoffiness. 
    It's worth considering how the question can be approached. 
    It sure sounds plausible that in fact )we( are the only ones who have to feel like we have seen scores settled; that love in terms of sacrifice is native only to a society of scarcity.  Maybe the Messiah story is a tale not of a body feeding itself into cosmic gears [to love us thiiis much]but of a victim walking into our scapegoating mechanism and letting us behold its impotence, and the impotence of our bitterness  [to show us our hearts in thiiis depth]. A bitterness that Christianity often only serves to dredge up. 
    to read much of a book called Things Hidden Since The Foundation Of The World is a sweet and just perhaps incomparable way of considering what is true about sacrifice and whether this is or it isn't. Reading 5% has suggested a lot to me, in a world where I write since I have not seen a "gospel" that can connect to so many of we disenchanted (or even give us back a bible as something we can read!) no matter how clever the examples you post to illustrate.
    If TAMU doesn't have a copy I can drop each of you this one for a while. In an unexpected way it has, I think, given me back bibles as things I can think about. 
    It may also more than make up for the substance of the long-delayed November reply comment I haven't posted.

    Hey, 2 things:
    1. I'm not sure if I'm the friend mentioned in paragraph 2, but I have used a variation of those questions.  I don't use them to evaluate an entire service (the liturgy, as you point out, tends to save Lutherans from what would otherwise be Godless services), but rather to evaluate sermons.  And I don't listen for mention of the Triune God (though that would be good, too), but just for what the sermon says about Jesus.
    I got those questions from Issues, Etc., a radio show/podcast that occasionally evaluates sermon messages.  They point out that Jesus said the Spirit would testify of Him -- thus, Spirit-led preaching will be about Jesus.
    2. You might like the book The Fire and the Staff, by Klemet Preus (http://www.amazon.com/Fire-Staff-Lutheran-Theology-Practice/dp/0758604041/).  Gottfried and I both read it recently, and it addresses some of these issues.
    The problem with "secrets to living your life better" is that they (1) have basically nothing to do with Christ or why He came, and (2) do not preach to all parts of the world.  The Gospel is truly for all people, but people in an impoverished country aren't exactly looking for the "secrets to a healthy marriage," I would guess.  They *would* be interested in eternal salvation and Christ's victory over death, though, or at least that applies to them.

    Hey Mike,
    I enjoyed reading this.  You articulated it well.  I have a few thoughts:
    <i>"But if he's the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, I at least have something to start analyzing... [The Bible is] chock full of promises and prophesies."</i>
    This is one of the key reasons Christianity is worth checking out.  Many other religions make claims that you can't truly check out critically.  For example, Mormons want you to pray about the Book of Mormon and see if you feel that it's true, but that requires you to trust your *feelings*, and I know I can't do that.  The Bible makes factual claims (most notably, that Jesus rose from the dead), and you can examine the evidence for those claims.
    Craig Parton writes about that in his book Religion on Trial -- it's worth reading:
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Religion-Trial-Craig-Parton/dp/155635715X" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Religion-Trial-Craig-Parton/dp/155635715X</a>
    But you started your post talking about church making you sick.  I can relate.  For a few years we were members of a church where the message was either "God loves you, now go get to work!" or, worse yet, just "Go get to work!"  Self-help sermon series, singing about what <i>I</i> am going to do instead of what Christ has done, and treating God like a buddy or life-coach... it really does make you feel sick to your stomach.
    We transfered to Trinity Lutheran in Austin, and we are truly getting Law and Gospel every Sunday, and the sacraments are faithfully observed.  You can read or listen to Pastor Harris's sermons on the church website:
    <a href="http://www.trinityaustin.com/sermons" rel="nofollow">http://www.trinityaustin.com/sermons</a>
    Before we transfered to Trinity, I listened to Issues, Etc. a lot (well, I still do).  If you haven't checked out that program, you might browse their archives for something interesting and give it a try:
    <a href="http://issuesetc.org/archive/" rel="nofollow">http://issuesetc.org/archive/</a>
    I would also mention another book by Craig Parton called The Defense Never Rests.  His defense of the historic Lutheran faith is worth reading.  Both of these books by Parton are pretty short.  The Defense Never Rests is also worth getting for its extensive annotated bibliography.
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Defense-Never-Rests-Lawyers-Gospel/dp/0758604823" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Defense-Never-Rests-Lawyers-Gospel/dp/0758604823</a>
    Finally, I'll say one more thing about changing churches.  It was hard, and we lost contact with a lot of people we loved.  However, I no long leave church angry -- I now leave forgiven.
    Take care,
    Derek

    You have had a profound impact on my life.  Your witness was in your actions which consistently spoke louder than words.  The subtle things...words you didn't say, pictures you didn't look at.  Those were the things that spoke loudest of your faith.  Also, your faith in and support of others.  Thank you for your willingness to follow God.  He has made you his instrument in my life.

    First!
    Where is the "Like" button?
    It's such a wonderful story, though painful to read at times (particularly the parts about the catheter).  I'm glad to know that you made it through and were able to recognize the beauty and the hands of God throughout the process.  Thank you for sharing.

    Wow, thanks for sharing the whole story-- or at least what you remember of it!  You're definitely a walking miracle!  You're also a walking blessing!  So thankful for your heart for sharing Christ's love with others, Mike!

    Thank you for writing this, man.  I laughed really hard at the Rock Paper Scissors exchange.  I have stolen your "I always do paper" approach to that game many times!
    I like to imagine God looking at you in the worst of this and thinking, "Mike can't die yet.  There are still people who aren't sufficiently pissed off by his opinions about facebook."  See, your life has a purpose!
    I am sorry I didn't like, comment, call, or visit.  We were among the many praying for you, though, and we're relieved and thankful that you're better now!

    Mike, you should make this into a children's book.  It is fantastic, especially the verse from the Grandpa and Grandma.

But I appreciate the encouragement.
