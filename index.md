Welcome old and new friends to the even more Modern Day Fuwjax. I've left Blogger for the greener pastures of GitHub Pages. Please let me know if you spot any issues I didn't address during the migration. The old comments will be added to the content; new comments will use Facebook comments. If you're so inclined, feel free to contact me on any of the networks on the left. Enjoy!
