> Clay pigeons are an unsatisfying kill - trivial to clean and the driest of cuisine. Their utility resides in training the mind and body to take aim and fire with confidence and consistency.

Welcome old and new friends to the even more Modern Day Fuwjax. I've left Blogger for the greener pastures of GitHub Pages. Please let me know if you spot any issues I didn't address during the migration. The only thing I still have planned besides layout tweaks is hand picked "You might also enjoy" links at the end of posts. The old comments have been added to the content; new comments will use Facebook. If you're so inclined, feel free to contact me on any of the networks on the left. Enjoy!
